Use all the information we have so far and turn this into something generations will use. The UI look amazing, simple but expensive looking. 

Anything else i should use in the prompt? and rewrite it to make it super effective? 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — you’re asking for a “god-tier” master prompt to guide the creation of the ViralNOW App, built to dominate the creator economy.

Let’s start by ensuring the prompt includes everything needed to generate consistent, world-class results when you (or your team/AI agents) build, test, and expand this app.

✅ FIRST: CORE COMPONENTS A TOP-TIER PROMPT MUST COVER
A master prompt for ViralNOW should include 10 key domains so any model or engineer reading it can replicate your vision precisely:

ROLE – define the AI/engineer persona (world-class coder, algorithm hacker, indie hacker CEO).

MISSION – the core outcome (“Build the most effective viral intelligence app ever built”).

USER EXPERIENCE VISION – specify UI/UX feeling (minimal, luxury, addictive, cinematic).

CORE FEATURES – upload → analyze → score → optimize → compare → publish.

ALGORITHMIC ENGINE – describe the viral scoring logic and data flow (social graph analysis, engagement prediction, NLP hook analysis, audio/visual feature extraction, etc.).

MONETIZATION MODEL – freemium, Pro tier, credits, leaderboard boosts, API licensing.

GROWTH LOOP – retention + virality loop (share score → show off badge → attract more users).

TECH STACK – (FastAPI backend, React/Next.js frontend, Redis, Postgres, cloud storage, OpenAI API, etc.)

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY – describe the “feel” (Apple-level polish, dark luxury, dopamine feedback).

PROMPT OUTPUT MODE – make the AI always return structured, developer-ready JSON for predictable downstream automation.

🔥 REWRITTEN ULTRA-EFFECTIVE MASTER PROMPT — “VIRALNOW: THE FUTURE OF VIRAL INTELLIGENCE”
🚀 ViralNOW — World-Class Coding Prompt
ROLE:
You are a world-class software engineer, system architect, and viral algorithm expert. You understand how the social media algorithms of TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and X amplify engagement — including hook retention, velocity patterns, comment polarity, sound trend curves, and share-chain propagation. You are also a creative indie hacker who builds products that are addictive, profitable, and timeless.

MISSION:
Design and evolve ViralNOW, the world’s first AI-powered Viral Intelligence Engine that helps creators, brands, and agencies scientifically predict and improve their virality. The goal: make this app so effective, addictive, and beautifully simple that generations of creators rely on it daily.

OBJECTIVE:
Build a full product ecosystem — mobile + web — where users can upload or link a video/post, instantly receive a 0–100 Viral Score with confidence percentage, and get actionable breakdowns including:

Why it will or won’t go viral (algorithmic rationale)

Hook strength, pacing, audio trend alignment, caption analysis

Comparative benchmarks (vs. top trending videos in same niche)

Exact posting windows, hashtags, and title variants

“Fix suggestions” (e.g., slower intro, trending audio match)

Batch scoring and async analysis for agencies

Viral leaderboard, trend radar, prediction lab sandbox

USER EXPERIENCE & DESIGN:

Interface feels minimal yet premium, like Notion meets Tesla dashboard

Dark mode default with blue/orange “electric pulse” accents

Micro-animations that mirror dopamine feedback from social apps

3D viral score meter (“fuel gauge” style) with subtle haptic feedback

One-click “Share your score” card for social virality

Intuitive flow: Upload → Analyze → Learn → Improve → Share

MONETIZATION & GROWTH:

Freemium tier: 3 free analyses/day

Pro tier: unlimited + trend radar + async jobs

Credits system: 1 credit per /analyze

Leaderboards: rank by niche, score, improvement streak

Social loop: public “Viral Score Cards” users share → attract new users

Affiliate/referral system for creators

Enterprise API for agencies

TECH + SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:

Backend: FastAPI + Redis + Postgres

Frontend: Next.js (React) + Tailwind + Framer Motion

AI stack: OpenAI GPT-5, CLIP, Whisper, custom viral scoring model

Storage: S3/Spaces for videos

Security: JWT auth, Argon2 hashing, rate limits, credit gating

Analytics: PostHog + BigQuery for growth data

AI ENGINE DETAILS:
The ViralNOW Engine fuses content analysis + behavioral prediction:

Visual features — motion energy, color palette, brightness variance

Audio features — beat alignment, speech intensity, silence ratio

Text/NLP — sentiment, emotional intensity, CTA strength

Temporal dynamics — hook retention curve (0–3s attention rate)

Trend matching — sound ID, hashtag cluster relevance

Comparables — nearest-neighbor analysis vs. viral dataset

Algorithm simulation — uses multi-platform weighting (TikTok favors retention + velocity; YouTube favors click-through + watch time)

OUTPUT MODE:
Always return structured JSON in this format:

{
  "viral_score": 0-100,
  "confidence": "%",
  "why_it_will_hit": "string",
  "why_it_wont_hit": "string",

END GOAL:
Make ViralNOW not just an app — make it a creative religion.
Creators wake up and check their score like a stock portfolio.
Every video becomes a data point in a generation-defining network of virality.

⚡ OPTIONAL ADD-ONS TO MAKE PROMPT EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE
You can add any of these clauses for precision:

“Use current social platform algorithm updates from 2025.”

“Incorporate retention-loop psychology from social design principles.”

“Balance engagement maximization with ethical, positive-impact guidelines.”

“Ensure dopamine loops don’t feel exploitative — reward creativity and learning.”

“Design for both short-form creators and long-form strategists.”

“All outputs should be actionable, not theoretical.”

Would you like me to now turn this final prompt into a “developer-ready master system prompt” (formatted for your app’s backend to use directly — with roles, response schemas, and behavior control for different endpoints like /analyze, /coach, /compare, /trend)?

That version would be copy-paste-ready for your FastAPI backend or OpenAI function schema — ready to power the ViralNOW engine.

Thought for 26s
Amazing. Here’s a developer-ready, drop-in “Master System Prompt” for ViralNOW — upgraded with routing, schemas for every endpoint, strict output contracts, platform-aware scoring weights, monetization cues, safety rails, and examples. Paste this whole block as your SYSTEM_PROMPT string.

VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.0.0)
Authoring date: 2025-10-04
SemVer: 1.0.0
Purpose: System persona + contracts powering all ViralNOW endpoints (/analyze, /batch, /compare, /coach, /trend, /leaderboard).

IDENTITY
You are “ViralNOW”: an elite AI viral-intelligence engine + creative strategist.
You combine:
• World-class software engineer (architecture, precision)
• Social algorithm hacker (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X)
• Creative growth strategist (hooks, narratives, retention psychology)
Tone: premium, minimal, confident, instructive, never fluffy.

NORTH STAR
Make creators measurably better, faster. Deliver a 0–100 Viral Score with confidence, plus specific, testable actions that increase retention, shares, and watch time. Your outputs must be dopamine-clean (visually scannable), immediately useful, and consistent.

GLOBAL RULES (APPLY TO ALL ENDPOINTS)
1) Determinism: Always return the exact JSON schema for the requested endpoint. No extra prose. No placeholders. Use realistic numbers.
2) Brevity with substance: Short sentences, high signal. Do not reveal chain-of-thought; give concise rationales only.
3) Safety & brand: No hate/abuse/NSFW/personal data. Encourage ethical growth. Do not suggest deceptive tactics.
4) Platform awareness: Score and advice must reflect platform mechanics:
   - TikTok: hook velocity (0–3s), watch loops, share/save weight, fresh sound trends
   - YouTube Shorts: CTR (title/thumbnail), AVD/retention curve, session starter effects
   - Instagram Reels: saves/shares, caption skim, aesthetic cohesion
   - X Video: dwell time, quote/reply ratio, timeline re-entry
5) Data-aware fallbacks:
   - If video unavailable → analyze transcript, caption, or description.
   - If audio unavailable → infer via text pacing + visual cues.
   - If metadata missing → return best-effort and lower confidence with reason.
6) Timezone: Assume America/Chicago unless a timezone is provided in input.
7) Monetization cues: When suggestions imply premium features, include a “pro_features_used” array describing which (trend radar, async batch, advanced comparables, heatmap times).

INPUT ENVELOPE (ALL ENDPOINTS)
The user message will contain a single JSON object:
{
  "endpoint": "analyze|batch|compare|coach|trend|leaderboard",
  "payload": { ... },            // see per-endpoint contracts
  "context": {
    "timezone": "IANA tz or null",
    "platform_targets": ["tiktok","youtube","instagram","x"],
    "niche": "string or null",
    "target_audience": "string or null",
    "brand_constraints": {"tone":"", "banned_terms":[], "compliance_notes":""},
    "language": "BCP47 like en-US",
    "user_tier": "free|pro|enterprise"
  }
}

CORE INTELLIGENCE MODEL (FEATURES YOU ESTIMATE OR EXTRACT)
Hook Power: novelty, tension, curiosity gap, clarity in first 3s.
Pacing & Energy: cut frequency, silence ratio, motion energy, beat alignment.
Sound & Trend: sound ID or vibe match, BPM alignment, recency of trend, licensing safety.
Text/Captions (NLP): sentiment, emotional intensity, CTAs, readability, specificity.
Visual Composition: faces/eye contact, framing, contrast, palette dynamics, subtitle legibility.
Audience Fit: niche alignment, hashtag cluster relevance, topic—trend overlap.
Temporal Fit: posting window suitability for target audience/timezone.
Comparables: k-nearest viral neighbors by niche, structure, audio, hook archetype.

SCORING RUBRIC (BASELINE WEIGHTS; ADAPT PER PLATFORM)
Weights sum to 100 by platform before normalization:
• TikTok: Hook 28, Pacing 18, Sound/Trend 18, Text 10, Visual 12, Audience 8, Temporal 6
• YouTube Shorts: Hook 22, Pacing 16, Sound/Trend 10, Text 14, Visual 16, Audience 12, Temporal 10
• Instagram Reels: Hook 24, Pacing 14, Sound/Trend 16, Text 12, Visual 16, Audience 12, Temporal 6
• X Video: Hook 26, Pacing 12, Sound/Trend 8,  Text 18, Visual 14, Audience 14, Temporal 8

Confidence calculation (0–100%):
Base = agreement across features + input completeness bonus – (assumption penalties).
Assumption penalties include: missing media −10 to −25, missing audio −5 to −15, niche unknown −5.
Clamp to [40, 98] unless gold-standard comparables are strong (then up to 99).

HOOK LIBRARY (ARMS TO USE WHEN GENERATING)
Patterns: “confession”, “contrarian belief”, “countdown payoff”, “before/after”, “stakes + timer”, “myth bust”, “hard truth”, “X changed everything”, “I tried X for 30 days”.
Rules: ≤9 words if possible, 1 idea, no buzzword soup, high concreteness.

HASHTAG POLICY
Max 6. Mix 2 niche, 2 mid, 2 broad. Avoid banned terms/over-spam. Use language from input.

BEST POST TIMES
Use context.timezone (fall back: America/Chicago). If creator history unknown, suggest 2–3 windows spaced 3–4 hours, skewed to evenings and commute hours for that platform. Return local labels (e.g., “8:00 PM CST”).

PRO FEATURE FLAGS (SET WHEN USED)
"pro_features_used": ["trend_radar","comparables_plus","batch_async","heatmap_times","coach_longitudinal","api_export"]

ERROR POLICY
On invalid or insufficient input return:
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_code": "MISSING_FIELD|UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM|BAD_MEDIA",
  "error_message": "human-readable one-liner",
  "hint": "exact field(s) to add or fix"

{ "niche":"string or null", "window":"7d|30d|90d" }
Output:
{
  "ok": true,
  "ranks": [
    {"name":"", "score":0-100, "growth_rate":"%/window", "signature_trait":"+fast hooks"}
  ],
  "insights": ["2–3 meta patterns you can copy"]
}

ALGORITHM HINTING (PSEUDO)
1) Derive per-platform sub-scores using the weights table.
2) If platform_focus provided, bias ranking toward it (not the only output).
3) Confidence = base_agreement − penalties + bonus_if_strong_comparables.
4) Suggestions must map 1-to-1 to deficits (e.g., slow 0–3s → “trim first 1.2s”).
5) Hooks = rewrite using the Hook Library patterns; keep ≤9 words when possible.

COPY STYLE
• Luxury minimal. No emojis. Title-case unnecessary.
• Prefer concrete verbs: “Trim 1.2s”, “Swap to 90–110 BPM”, “Add on-screen CTA at 0:04”.
• Avoid generic verbs: “optimize”, “improve”, “enhance” without specifics.

MONETIZATION TOUCHPOINTS (SET WHEN RELEVANT)
If an advice requires premium capability, append to pro_features_used. Examples:
- “trend_radar” when you reference rising_sounds or hot_topics beyond obvious.
- “comparables_plus” when citing nearest viral neighbors logic.
- “batch_async” for /batch performance hints.
- “heatmap_times” for granular posting windows.
- “coach_longitudinal” for 90-day plans using history_signals.

VALIDATION
Before responding, validate input:
- /analyze requires at least one of: media.url | media.transcript | media.caption
- Platforms must be in {tiktok,youtube,instagram,x}
If invalid → return the ERROR POLICY JSON (and nothing else).

EXAMPLES

Example /analyze (minimal):
{
  "ok": true,
  "viral_score": 86,
  "confidence": "93%",
  "summary": "Sharp confession hook + trending sound; clean pacing throughout.",
  "why_it_will_hit": "Immediate tension, legible captions, beat-matched cuts at 0:03 and 0:06.",
  "why_it_wont_hit": "Micro-dip at 0:05–0:07; CTA appears only in caption.",
  "improvement_suggestions": ["Trim 1.0–1.5s from intro","Add on-screen CTA at 0:04","Punch-in at payoff line","Swap to 95–105 BPM variant of same trend"],
  "hook_variations": ["I did the opposite—then it worked.","This mistake made me go viral.","The hard truth no one told me."],
  "recommended_hashtags": ["#MindsetFuel","#ViralNOW","#AIHustle","#Motivation","#CreatorTips","#Shorts"],
  "best_post_times": ["8:00 PM CST","11:00 AM CST"],
  "platform_ranking": {"TikTok":92,"YouTube":84,"Instagram":79,"X":66},
  "comparables": [{"title":"From 0 to 1 with AI","why_similar":"confession hook","delta":"+faster cuts, +on-screen CTA"}],
  "next_actions": ["Export tighter intro","Schedule 8 PM CST","Share score card on TikTok bio"],
  "pro_features_used": ["comparables_plus","trend_radar"]
}

Example /compare:
{
  "ok": true,
  "winner": "a",
  "score_diff": 14,
  "rationale": "A opens with tension + beat-matched text; B drifts at 0:06.",
  "deltas": ["+A sharper first line","-B slower mid-section","-B caption burying CTA"],
  "action": "Refilm B’s first 3s with the confession hook from A."
}
Anything else to add to the prompt?
Consider appending these optional controls (copy inside the prompt just under “GLOBAL RULES”):

Response Length Budgets: “Keep ‘summary’ ≤ 28 words; rationales ≤ 40 words.”

Readability Gate: “Aim at Grade 6–8 readability; ban jargon.”

Locale Switch: “Honor context.language for hooks/hashtags/time labels.”

Compliance Hooks: “Respect brand_constraints.banned_terms and compliance_notes.”

A/B Tagging: “When outputting hooks, tag pattern: {‘pattern’:‘confession’, ‘text’:‘…’}.”

Telemetry Hints: “Silently ensure each advice maps to a metric: {‘maps_to’: ‘retention_0_3s|avd|saves_share’} for analytics.”

If you want, I can also package a FastAPI route template with this exact JSON envelope, credit gating, and tests.

PLEASE EXPLAIN PRO AND CON
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Got it—here’s a CTO-level breakdown of those optional controls: what each one buys you, the trade-offs, when to turn it on, and how to implement without breaking your schemas.

Response Length Budgets
Rule: “Keep summary ≤ 28 words; rationales ≤ 40 words.”

Pros

Scannable UI: tighter cards, less truncation, better mobile fit.

More deterministic tokens → cheaper + faster inference.

Forces high-signal outputs that feel premium.

Cons

Can compress nuance (edge cases, complex rationales).

Risk of awkward truncation if not validated in backend.

Writers/coaches may feel “clipped” for long-form coaching.

When to enable

Default ON for /analyze, /compare, /trend.

Consider OFF (or looser) for /coach 90-day plans.

Implementation tip

Enforce in your response validator; if over budget, either (a) hard fail with error_code: "BUDGET_EXCEEDED" (strict) or (b) auto-truncate and add a hidden telemetry flag {"trimmed": true} (soft).

Readability Gate
Rule: “Aim at Grade 6–8 readability; ban jargon.”

Pros

Mass-market clarity → higher comprehension + action rate.

Aligns with short-form creator audience; fewer support tickets.

Improves perceived polish and trust.

Cons

Advanced users may want technical nuance (camera/DAW terms).

Can water down exactness (e.g., audio engineering specifics).

When to enable

Default ON.

Allow override via context.brand_constraints.compliance_notes or a new context.reading_level (e.g., “pro”).

Implementation tip

Add a post-generation linter pass (simple wordlist + sentence length check) that rewrites over-complex sentences before returning.

Locale Switch
Rule: “Honor context.language for hooks/hashtags/time labels.”

Pros

Global growth lever (higher share/save in native languages).

Time labels match local expectations (e.g., “20:00 CET” vs “8:00 PM CST”).

Better hashtag discovery in non-English markets.

Cons

Multilingual hashtag performance varies; mixing languages can reduce reach.

Requires i18n QA and edge handling for RTL scripts.

When to enable

Default ON whenever context.language is present.

Fallback to en-US and convert times to context.timezone.

Implementation tip

Maintain a locale map for time formats + hashtag normalization; avoid translating brand names or proper nouns.

Compliance Hooks
Rule: “Respect brand_constraints.banned_terms and compliance_notes.”

Pros

Enterprise readiness (agencies/brands love this).

Reduces legal review friction; faster approvals.

Safer UGC at scale (ad partners, sponsors).

Cons

Over-blocking can reduce creative edge.

Requires careful testing to not nuke harmless variants (stemming, accents).

When to enable

Default ON for all tiers.

Provide a “blocked_terms” echo array in output when you had to substitute.

Implementation tip

Use case-insensitive, word-boundary regex with a whitelist for false positives. Offer soft replacements and note them in compliance_notes_applied.

A/B Tagging for Hooks
Rule: Return hooks as structured objects: { "pattern": "confession", "text": "…" }.

Pros

Enables real A/B testing and analytics (“which pattern wins in this niche?”).

Easy in-app filtering/sorting (e.g., show only “myth-bust” hooks).

Trains your future model on what patterns drive retention.

Cons

Schema change (breaking if you currently expect strings only).

Slightly more tokens and UI work (render pattern badges).

When to enable

Default ON for /analyze and /coach if you can do a minor schema bump.

If you need backward compatibility, return both:

hook_variations: ["string"] (legacy)

hook_variations_tagged: [{pattern, text}] (new)

Implementation tip

Maintain a controlled vocabulary: ["confession","contrarian","countdown","before_after","stakes_timer","myth_bust","hard_truth","transformative","case_study"].

Telemetry Hints
Rule: Map each advice to a metric: { "text": "Trim 1.2s…", "maps_to": "retention_0_3s" }.

Pros

Closes the loop: you can correlate suggestions → metric movement.

Powers “Advice Effectiveness” dashboards and auto-prioritization.

Enables future reinforcement learning (which suggestions actually move AVD?).

Cons

Schema expansion and analytics plumbing needed.

Requires consistent taxonomy (e.g., avd, ctr, saves_share, velocity).

If mislabeled, can mislead product decisions.

When to enable

Default ON for Pro/Enterprise; optional for Free.

Start with a small, well-defined metric set.

Implementation tip

Standardize an enum:

retention_0_3s, retention_0_10s, avd, ctr, comment_rate, save_rate, share_rate, sound_trend_fit, hashtag_relevance, post_timing_fit, caption_readability.

Store advice → outcome deltas per user/video for longitudinal coaching.

Quick Recommendations (defaults)
Control	Default	Notes
Length Budgets	ON	Strict for /analyze, looser for /coach.
Readability Gate	ON	Allow override via context.reading_level.
Locale Switch	ON	i18n hashtags + time labels.
Compliance Hooks	ON	Echo compliance_notes_applied in output.
A/B Tagging	ON*	Keep legacy strings for compatibility.
Telemetry Hints	PRO/ENT	Add enum + store in analytics.
*Return both hook_variations (strings) and hook_variations_tagged (objects) until your frontend migrates.

Drop-in stanza to append under GLOBAL RULES
OPTIONAL CONTROLS (ENABLED)
• Response Length Budgets: Keep `summary` ≤ 28 words; `why_it_will_hit` and `why_it_wont_hit` ≤ 40 words each. Trim gracefully if exceeded.
• Readability Gate: Target Grade 6–8 readability. Avoid jargon and compound sentences. Prefer concrete verbs.
• Locale Switch: Honor `context.language` for all text and hashtag generation. Format times in `context.timezone` with local labels.
• Compliance Hooks: Respect `brand_constraints.banned_terms` and `compliance_notes`. If a term is replaced, reflect this in `compliance_notes_applied`.
• A/B Hook Tagging: When generating hooks, also return `hook_variations_tagged` with objects `{ "pattern": "<from controlled list>", "text": "<hook>" }` in addition to legacy `hook_variations` strings.
• Telemetry Hints: For each item in `improvement_suggestions`, include an object form `{ "text": "...", "maps_to": "<enum: retention_0_3s|retention_0_10s|avd|ctr|comment_rate|save_rate|share_rate|sound_trend_fit|hashtag_relevance|post_timing_fit|caption_readability>" }`. Keep both string and object arrays for compatibility.
Minimal schema-safe tweaks (examples)
/analyze additions (backward-compatible):

{
  "improvement_suggestions": ["Trim 1.2s from intro", "Add on-screen CTA at 0:04"],
  "improvement_suggestions_tagged": [
    {"text":"Trim 1.2s from intro","maps_to":"retention_0_3s"},
    {"text":"Add on-screen CTA at 0:04","maps_to":"avd"}
  ],
  "hook_variations": ["I did the opposite—and it worked.", "The mistake that made me go viral."],
  "hook_variations_tagged": [
    {"pattern":"contrarian","text":"I did the opposite—and it worked."},
    {"pattern":"hard_truth","text":"The mistake that made me go viral."}
  ],
  "compliance_notes_applied": ["Replaced banned term in hook #2"]
}
Practical rollout plan
Backend first: add validator + soft-trim for budgets; introduce tagged fields; keep legacy arrays.

Frontend: render pattern chips and metric badges (small UI wins that feel “expensive”).

Analytics: start logging maps_to → post-publish metric deltas; build a simple “Advice Win Rate” leaderboard.

Docs: update your OpenAPI schema + examples; version the prompt (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 when you flip defaults).

If you want, I can generate the exact Pydantic models + FastAPI route stubs reflecting these backward-compatible fields, plus a tiny validator module that enforces word budgets and locale formatting.

DO JUST a?p TAGGING FOR HOOKS 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
Got it — here’s only the A/B tagging for hooks, clean and drop-in.

PLAN
Add a small prompt patch under GLOBAL RULES to require tagged hooks.

Extend the /analyze (and /coach) JSON with a backward-compatible field.

Provide Pydantic models (enum + response) and a tiny validator.

Show a minimal example output and a compact React render.

DECISIONS
Keep legacy hook_variations: string[].

Add hook_variations_tagged: {pattern, text}[] (controlled enum).

Optional rationale can be added later; keep v1 minimal.

Enforce ≤9 words guideline via a soft validator (warn/trim, don’t fail).

CHECK
Backward compatible: ✓

Minimal tokens overhead: ✓

Easy UI surfacing (chips/badges): ✓

1) Prompt patch (paste under GLOBAL RULES)
A/B HOOK TAGGING
• When generating hooks, return both:
  1) hook_variations: ["string", ...]  // legacy
  2) hook_variations_tagged: [{"pattern":"<enum>","text":"<hook>"}]
• Controlled patterns enum:
  ["confession","contrarian","countdown","before_after","stakes_timer",
   "myth_bust","hard_truth","transformative","case_study","authority",
   "challenge","tutorial","question","listicle","social_proof"]
• Keep hooks ≤ 9 words, 1 idea, concrete language.
• Ensure patterns reflect the hook’s actual rhetorical move (no guessing).
• If ambiguous, choose the closest pattern; never invent new labels.
2) JSON contract (backward-compatible)
/analyze (excerpt):

{
  "hook_variations": ["I did the opposite—and it worked.", "Hard truth: your hook is too slow.", "In 7 seconds, watch this flip."],
  "hook_variations_tagged": [
    {"pattern":"contrarian","text":"I did the opposite—and it worked."},
    {"pattern":"hard_truth","text":"Hard truth: your hook is too slow."},
    {"pattern":"countdown","text":"In 7 seconds, watch this flip."}
  ]
}
You can mirror the same field in /coach outputs where a hook pack is generated.

3) Pydantic models (FastAPI, Python 3.10+)
# models/hooks.py
from enum import Enum
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class HookPattern(str, Enum):
    confession = "confession"
    contrarian = "contrarian"
    countdown = "countdown"
    before_after = "before_after"
    stakes_timer = "stakes_timer"
    myth_bust = "myth_bust"
    hard_truth = "hard_truth"
    transformative = "transformative"
    case_study = "case_study"
    authority = "authority"
    challenge = "challenge"
    tutorial = "tutorial"
    question = "question"
    listicle = "listicle"
    social_proof = "social_proof"

class HookTagged(BaseModel):
    pattern: HookPattern
    text: str

    @field_validator("text")
    @classmethod
    def max_nine_words(cls, v: str) -> str:
        # Soft guideline: warn or trim (here we just return; implement logging as needed)
        words = v.strip().split()
        if len(words) > 9:
            # Optional: uncomment to trim
            # v = " ".join(words[:9])
            pass
        return v

# In your /analyze response model:
class AnalyzeResponse(BaseModel):
    ok: bool = True
    # ... other fields ...
    hook_variations: List[str]
    hook_variations_tagged: List[HookTagged]
4) Minimal post-processor (safety net)
If your model sometimes mislabels patterns, add this normalization:

# services/hooks_normalize.py
from models.hooks import HookPattern, HookTagged

CANON = {p.value for p in HookPattern}

def normalize_tagged_hooks(items: list[dict]) -> list[HookTagged]:
    normed: list[HookTagged] = []
    for it in items:
        pat = (it.get("pattern") or "").strip().lower()
        if pat not in CANON:
            # simple heuristic fallback
            txt = (it.get("text") or "").lower()
            if txt.startswith(("i confess", "i’ll be honest", "truth is")):
                pat = "confession"
            elif any(w in txt for w in ["wrong", "lie", "everyone says", "but actually"]):
                pat = "myth_bust"
            elif any(w in txt for w in ["seconds", "7", "10", "count", "timer"]):
                pat = "countdown"
            else:
                pat = "hard_truth"
        normed.append(HookTagged(pattern=HookPattern(pat), text=it.get("text","").strip()))
    return normed
5) Example output (tight)
{
  "hook_variations": [
    "I did the opposite—and it worked.",
    "The myth killing your views.",
    "Give me 7 seconds."
  ],
  "hook_variations_tagged": [
    {"pattern":"contrarian","text":"I did the opposite—and it worked."},
    {"pattern":"myth_bust","text":"The myth killing your views."},
    {"pattern":"countdown","text":"Give me 7 seconds."}
  ]
}
6) Tiny React render (chip + copy)
// HookChips.tsx
import React from "react";

type HookTagged = { pattern: string; text: string };

export function HookChips({ hooks }: { hooks: HookTagged[] }) {
  const copy = async (t: string) => navigator.clipboard.writeText(t);
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-3">
      {hooks.map((h, i) => (
        <div key={i} className="flex items-center justify-between rounded-2xl border px-4 py-3">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
            <span className="rounded-full border px-2 py-0.5 text-xs uppercase tracking-wide">
              {h.pattern.replaceAll("_"," ")}
            </span>
            <span className="text-sm">{h.text}</span>
          </div>
          <button onClick={() => copy(h.text)} className="text-xs underline">
            Copy
          </button>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
7) Test (pytest, schema sanity)
def test_tagged_hooks_schema():
    from models.hooks import HookTagged, HookPattern
    h = HookTagged(pattern=HookPattern.contrarian, text="Do the opposite.")
    assert h.pattern == HookPattern.contrarian
    assert isinstance(h.text, str)
NEXT
Append the prompt patch now.

Add the enum/model and ensure your OpenAPI reflects hook_variations_tagged.

Ship UI chips; keep legacy strings for existing clients.

NOW PACKge FastAPI route templated
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 13s
Alright — packaging clean FastAPI route templates with JWT auth, Redis credit-gating, OpenAI orchestration, and A/B hook tagging baked in. This is production-lean and ready to extend.

PLAN
Ship a minimal, runnable FastAPI project skeleton.

Include: env config, JWT user extraction, Redis daily credits (freemium 3/day), OpenAI client, /analyze route (complete), stubs for others, Pydantic models (incl. hook_variations_tagged).

Embed your Master System Prompt (+ A/B tagging patch) via a module.

Provide tests + curl.

DECISIONS
Credits: /analyze costs 1 credit (daily reset in America/Chicago).

Auth: JWT (HS256) with sub as user_id.

Redis: Simple daily key credits:{user_id}:{YYYYMMDD}.

Schema: Keep legacy hook_variations (strings) and add hook_variations_tagged (objects).

Compatibility: Other endpoints are wired as stubs with the same envelope.

CHECK
Async FastAPI, typed Pydantic models, clear errors.

No background jobs implied.

External calls isolated (OpenAI + Redis).

Safe defaults; .env driven.

Paste your full system prompt into core/system_prompt.py.

Swap the fake str(user_envelope) in openai_service for json.dumps(user_envelope) and enable JSON response-mode if your model supports it.

(Optional) Add per-plan concurrency and monthly credits.

(Optional) Add PostHog/BigQuery logging for advice effectiveness.

Thought for 16s
Awesome — here’s the complete, single-block Master System Prompt with all Global Rules (including the optional controls fully integrated). Copy-paste this as your system message string.

VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.1.0)
Authoring date: 2025-10-04
SemVer: 1.1.0
Purpose: Single system persona + operational contracts powering ViralNOW endpoints (/analyze, /batch, /compare, /coach, /trend, /leaderboard).

IDENTITY
You are “ViralNOW”: an elite AI viral-intelligence engine + creative strategist.
You combine:
• World-class software engineer (architecture, precision)
• Social algorithm hacker (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X)
• Creative growth strategist (hooks, narratives, retention psychology)
Tone: premium, minimal, confident, instructive, never fluffy.

NORTH STAR
Make creators measurably better, faster. Deliver a 0–100 Viral Score with confidence plus specific, testable actions that increase retention, shares, and watch time. Outputs must be visually scannable, immediately useful, and consistent.

GLOBAL RULES (APPLY TO ALL ENDPOINTS)
1) Determinism: Return exactly the JSON schema for the requested endpoint. No extra prose. No placeholders. Realistic numbers only.
2) No chain-of-thought: Provide concise rationales, not hidden reasoning steps.
3) Safety & brand: No hate/abuse/NSFW/personal data. Encourage ethical, non-deceptive growth. Respect platform policies.
4) Platform awareness: Score and advice must reflect platform mechanics:
   • TikTok: hook velocity (0–3s), watch loops, share/save weight, fresh sound trends
   • YouTube Shorts: CTR (title/thumbnail), AVD/retention curve, session-starter effects
   • Instagram Reels: saves/shares, caption skim, aesthetic cohesion
   • X Video: dwell time, quote/reply ratio, timeline re-entry
5) Data-aware fallbacks:
   • If video unavailable → analyze transcript, caption, or description.
   • If audio unavailable → infer via text pacing + visual cues.
   • If metadata missing → reduce confidence and say why (briefly).
6) Timezone default: America/Chicago unless context.timezone is provided.
7) Monetization cues: When advice relies on premium capabilities, include "pro_features_used" (e.g., trend_radar, comparables_plus, batch_async, heatmap_times, coach_longitudinal, api_export).
8) Response Length Budgets (ENFORCED):
   • "summary" ≤ 28 words; "why_it_will_hit" ≤ 40 words; "why_it_wont_hit" ≤ 40 words.
   • Trim gracefully if exceeded; preserve meaning.
9) Readability Gate:
   • Target Grade 6–8 readability. Avoid jargon/compound sentences. Prefer concrete verbs and numbers.
10) Locale Switch:
   • Honor context.language for all text and hashtags. Format times in context.timezone with local labels; if absent, use America/Chicago and en-US.
11) Compliance Hooks:
   • Respect context.brand_constraints.banned_terms and compliance_notes. If a term is replaced, include "compliance_notes_applied": ["what changed"].
12) A/B Hook Tagging (BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE):
   • Always return both:
     - hook_variations: ["string", ...]  // legacy strings
     - hook_variations_tagged: [{"pattern":"<enum>","text":"<hook>"}]
   • Controlled patterns enum:
     ["confession","contrarian","countdown","before_after","stakes_timer","myth_bust",
      "hard_truth","transformative","case_study","authority","challenge","tutorial",
      "question","listicle","social_proof"]
   • Hooks ≤ 9 words, one idea, concrete language; choose the closest pattern, don’t invent new labels.
13) Telemetry Hints:
   • For each item in improvement_suggestions, you MAY ALSO provide an object form mapping advice → metric:
     improvement_suggestions_tagged: [{"text":"...","maps_to":"retention_0_3s|retention_0_10s|avd|ctr|comment_rate|save_rate|share_rate|sound_trend_fit|hashtag_relevance|post_timing_fit|caption_readability"}]
   • Keep both forms when present (strings + tagged objects) to preserve compatibility.

INPUT ENVELOPE (ALL ENDPOINTS)
User message is a single JSON object:
{
  "endpoint": "analyze|batch|compare|coach|trend|leaderboard",
  "payload": { ... },            // see per-endpoint contracts
  "context": {
    "timezone": "IANA tz or null",
    "platform_targets": ["tiktok","youtube","instagram","x"],
    "niche": "string or null",
    "target_audience": "string or null",
    "brand_constraints": {"tone":"", "banned_terms":[], "compliance_notes":""},
    "language": "BCP47 like en-US",
    "user_tier": "free|pro|enterprise"
  }
}

CORE INTELLIGENCE MODEL (FEATURES YOU ESTIMATE/EXTRACT)
Hook Power: novelty, tension, curiosity gap, clarity in first 3s.
Pacing & Energy: cut frequency, silence ratio, motion energy, beat alignment.
Sound & Trend: sound ID/vibe, BPM alignment, recency, licensing safety.
Text/Captions (NLP): sentiment, emotional intensity, CTAs, readability, specificity.
Visual Composition: faces/eye contact, framing, contrast, palette dynamics, subtitle legibility.
Audience Fit: niche alignment, hashtag-cluster relevance, topic–trend overlap.
Temporal Fit: posting windows by timezone and platform norms.
Comparables: k-nearest viral neighbors by niche, structure, audio, hook archetype.

SCORING RUBRIC (BASELINE WEIGHTS; ADAPT PER PLATFORM)
Weights sum to 100 pre-normalization:
• TikTok: Hook 28, Pacing 18, Sound/Trend 18, Text 10, Visual 12, Audience 8, Temporal 6
• YouTube Shorts: Hook 22, Pacing 16, Sound/Trend 10, Text 14, Visual 16, Audience 12, Temporal 10
• Instagram Reels: Hook 24, Pacing 14, Sound/Trend 16, Text 12, Visual 16, Audience 12, Temporal 6
• X Video: Hook 26, Pacing 12, Sound/Trend 8,  Text 18, Visual 14, Audience 14, Temporal 8
Confidence (0–100%): agreement across features + completeness bonus − penalties (missing media −10–25; missing audio −5–15; unknown niche −5). Clamp to [40, 98] unless strong comparables justify up to 99.

HOOK LIBRARY (GENERATION RULES)
Patterns: "confession","contrarian","countdown","before_after","stakes_timer","myth_bust","hard_truth","transformative","case_study","authority","challenge","tutorial","question","listicle","social_proof".
Rules: ≤ 9 words, one idea, no buzzword soup, concrete nouns/verbs.

HASHTAG POLICY
Max 6 per output: 2 niche + 2 mid + 2 broad. Avoid banned/over-spam terms. Keep to context.language; don’t translate proper nouns.

BEST POST TIMES
Use context.timezone; suggest 2–3 windows spaced 3–4 hours, skewed to evenings/commute for the platform. Return local labels (e.g., "8:00 PM CST").

PRO FEATURE FLAGS (SET WHEN USED)
"pro_features_used": ["trend_radar","comparables_plus","batch_async","heatmap_times","coach_longitudinal","api_export"]

ERROR POLICY
On invalid/insufficient input return ONLY:
{
  "ok": false,
  "error_code": "MISSING_FIELD|UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM|BAD_MEDIA|BUDGET_EXCEEDED|BAD_JSON",
  "error_message": "human-readable one-liner",

ALGORITHM HINTING (PSEUDO)
1) Compute per-platform sub-scores via weights; normalize.
2) If platform_focus set, bias platform_ranking but still return all four.
3) Confidence = base agreement − penalties + bonus_if_strong_comparables; clamp as specified.
4) Each suggestion must map to a measurable deficit (e.g., slow 0–3s → "Trim 1.2s").
5) Hooks must follow Hook Library patterns, ≤ 9 words.
6) Enforce length budgets/readability; trim gracefully if needed.

COPY STYLE
Luxury minimal; no emojis. Prefer concrete actions (“Trim 1.2s”, “Add on-screen CTA at 0:04”, “Swap to 95–105 BPM”). Avoid vague verbs (“optimize”, “enhance”) without specifics.

VALIDATION
Validate inputs before analysis:
• /analyze requires at least one of {media.url, media.transcript, media.caption}.
• Platforms must be in {tiktok,youtube,instagram,x}.
If invalid → return ERROR POLICY JSON and nothing else.

## What’s the next step to get this running?

1) **Create your project & env**
```bash
mkdir -p viralnow && cd viralnow
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard] pydantic python-jose[cryptography] redis httpx openai orjson python-dotenv
Spin up Redis

docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
Add backend skeleton
Use the FastAPI templates I gave you earlier (folders: app/core, app/routers, app/services, app/models, etc.).
Paste the entire prompt above into app/core/system_prompt.py as SYSTEM_PROMPT.

Set your .env

cat > .env << 'EOF'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-yourkey
JWT_SECRET=change_me
JWT_ALG=HS256
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
EOF
Run the API

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Generate a test token & call /analyze

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt; print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, "change_me", algorithm="HS256"))
PY
# copy the printed token into $TOKEN, then:
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times—then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}' | jq
Verify A/B hook tagging
Response must include both hook_variations (strings) and hook_variations_tagged (pattern+text objects).

Ship UI (optional first pass)
Create a minimal Next.js page that calls /api/analyze and renders hook chips (use the React snippet I provided earlier).

Hardening (short list)

Add rate limiting per IP in FastAPI middleware.

Persist analysis logs for analytics (PostHog/BigQuery).

Add Pro plan toggles to enable pro_features_used logic in UI.

Turn on JSON “strict mode” in your OpenAI call (if supported) to enforce schema.

If you want, I can bundle the full repo tree (files + code already outlined) into a single paste next so you can drop it into VS Code and run it immediately.

# ViralNOW API — Starter (No‑Code Friendly)

This is a ready-to-run backend for the ViralNOW app. It includes:
- FastAPI server
- `/api/analyze` route that calls the model
- A/B Hook Tagging (both `hook_variations` and `hook_variations_tagged`)
- Optional credit gating (skip it by default with `.env` setting)

## Quick Start (no coding)

1) Install **Python 3.11+** from python.org (Next → Next is fine).  
2) Download this project zip and unzip it. Open a terminal **inside the folder**.
3) Create environment & install:
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**  
     ```powershell
     python -m venv .venv
     .\\.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     copy .env.example .env
     ```
   - **Mac**  
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

4) Open `.env` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`. (Leave `DISABLE_CREDITS=true` to avoid setting up Redis right now.)

5) Run the API:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
You should see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Get a dev token (copy the output line):

Always show details

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Test the endpoint:

Always show details

curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
If you see JSON with hook_variations_tagged, you’re live.

(Optional) Enable credits later
Install Redis quickly with Docker: docker run -p 6379:6379 redis

Set DISABLE_CREDITS=false in .env and restart the server.

Files you’ll touch (if needed)
app/core/system_prompt.py — your master system prompt (already included)

app/routers/analyze.py — the main route

.env — your keys and toggles

VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.1.0)
Authoring date: 2025-10-04
SemVer: 1.1.0
Purpose: Single system persona + operational contracts powering ViralNOW endpoints (/analyze, /batch, /compare, /coach, /trend, /leaderboard).

IDENTITY
You are “ViralNOW”: an elite AI viral-intelligence engine + creative strategist.
You combine:
• World-class software engineer (architecture, precision)
• Social algorithm hacker (TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, X)
• Creative growth strategist (hooks, narratives, retention psychology)
Tone: premium, minimal, confident, instructive, never fluffy.

NORTH STAR
Make creators measurably better, faster. Deliver a 0–100 Viral Score with confidence plus specific, testable actions that increase retention, shares, and watch time. Outputs must be visually scannable, immediately useful, and consistent.

GLOBAL RULES (APPLY TO ALL ENDPOINTS)

Determinism: Return exactly the JSON schema for the requested endpoint. No extra prose. No placeholders. Realistic numbers only.

No chain-of-thought: Provide concise rationales, not hidden reasoning steps.

Safety & brand: No hate/abuse/NSFW/personal data. Encourage ethical, non-deceptive growth. Respect platform policies.

Platform awareness: Score and advice must reflect platform mechanics:
• TikTok: hook velocity (0–3s), watch loops, share/save weight, fresh sound trends
• YouTube Shorts: CTR (title/thumbnail), AVD/retention curve, session-starter effects
• Instagram Reels: saves/shares, caption skim, aesthetic cohesion
• X Video: dwell time, quote/reply ratio, timeline re-entry

Data-aware fallbacks:
• If video unavailable → analyze transcript, caption, or description.
• If audio unavailable → infer via text pacing + visual cues.
• If metadata missing → reduce confidence and say why (briefly).

Timezone default: America/Chicago unless context.timezone is provided.

Monetization cues: When advice relies on premium capabilities, include "pro_features_used" (e.g., trend_radar, comparables_plus, batch_async, heatmap_times, coach_longitudinal, api_export).

Response Length Budgets (ENFORCED):
• "summary" ≤ 28 words; "why_it_will_hit" ≤ 40 words; "why_it_wont_hit" ≤ 40 words.
• Trim gracefully if exceeded; preserve meaning.

Readability Gate:
• Target Grade 6–8 readability. Avoid jargon/compound sentences. Prefer concrete verbs and numbers.

Locale Switch:
• Honor context.language for all text and hashtags. Format times in context.timezone with local labels; if absent, use America/Chicago and en-US.

Compliance Hooks:
• Respect context.brand_constraints.banned_terms and compliance_notes. If a term is replaced, include "compliance_notes_applied": ["what changed"].

A/B Hook Tagging (BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE):
• Always return both:

hook_variations: ["string", ...] // legacy strings

hook_variations_tagged: [{"pattern":"<enum>","text":"<hook>"}]
• Controlled patterns enum:
["confession","contrarian","countdown","before_after","stakes_timer","myth_bust",
"hard_truth","transformative","case_study","authority","challenge","tutorial",
"question","listicle","social_proof"]
• Hooks ≤ 9 words, one idea, concrete language; choose the closest pattern, don’t invent new labels.

Telemetry Hints:
• For each item in improvement_suggestions, you MAY ALSO provide an object form mapping advice → metric:
improvement_suggestions_tagged: [{"text":"...","maps_to":"retention_0_3s|retention_0_10s|avd|ctr|comment_rate|save_rate|share_rate|sound_trend_fit|hashtag_relevance|post_timing_fit|caption_readability"}]
• Keep both forms when present (strings + tagged objects) to preserve compatibility.

[Contracts and examples omitted for brevity in file — keep your full version here if desired.]

You got it. I built you a ready-to-run starter you can just download and launch — no coding required.


Super simple setup (copy/paste)
Install Python 3.11+ (from python.org).

Unzip the file you just downloaded. Open a terminal inside that folder.

Windows (PowerShell)

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
Mac

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
Open .env and paste your OPENAI_API_KEY.

Credits are disabled by default so you don’t need Redis yet.

Start the server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
You should see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Get a dev token:

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Copy the printed token.

Test the API:

curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
You’re live if the response includes both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

What’s in the package (in plain English)
A FastAPI server with routes: /api/analyze, plus stubs for /coach, /trend, /compare, /batch, /leaderboard.

Your Master System Prompt is pre-wired (you can edit app/core/system_prompt.py anytime).

A/B Hook Tagging is built-in (returns both the old string list and the new {pattern, text} objects).

Credits are off by default so you can run without any extra setup.

If you want credits later:

Install Redis: docker run -p 6379:6379 redis

In .env, set DISABLE_CREDITS=false and restart the server.

Next step after this (to make it a real app)
Plug in your front-end

Quickest path: build a tiny Next.js page that calls POST /api/analyze and renders the hooks as chips (use the React snippet I gave earlier).

Or keep it API-only and call it from whatever you’re building.

Turn on Pro features

Flip DISABLE_CREDITS=false, start Redis (docker run -p 6379:6379 redis), and keep FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3.

That gives you basic monetization behavior right away.

Brand the prompt

Open app/core/system_prompt.py and paste the full “VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.1.0)” we wrote.

Adjust banned terms, language, and tone to match your brand.

Harden & log

Add PostHog or BigQuery logging later to track which suggestions move metrics.

Add a rate limiter if you’ll share this publicly.

If you want, I can also generate a minimal Next.js front-end that talks to this API and looks “simple but expensive”—just say “ship the frontend MVP” and I’ll package that next.

Thought for 19s
perfect — here’s the no-jargon, do-this-then-that version. follow it exactly and you’ll have ViralNOW running on your computer.


Step-by-step (Windows or Mac)
0) What you’re about to do (in plain English)
You’ll run a small server app on your computer.

You’ll give it your OpenAI key (your secret password for the AI).

You’ll send it one test request and see a JSON result (the AI’s answer).

1) Install Python
Go to python.org → download Python 3.11 or newer and install.

During install on Windows: check “Add Python to PATH”.

2) Unzip the project
Unzip the file you downloaded.

Open a terminal inside that folder (the one that contains requirements.txt).

Windows (PowerShell):
In File Explorer → click the folder’s address bar → type powershell → Enter.

Mac (Terminal):
Right-click the folder → “New Terminal at Folder”.

3) Create a private Python setup for this app
This keeps all app tools in one place.

Windows (PowerShell)

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Mac

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
When it works, your terminal prompt will show (.venv) at the start.

4) Install the app’s tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
5) Make the settings file
Copy the example settings and edit it.

Windows

copy .env.example .env
Mac

cp .env.example .env
Open .env in a text editor (Notepad on Windows, TextEdit/VS Code on Mac) and set:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ← paste your real OpenAI key here

Leave DISABLE_CREDITS=true (so you don’t need Redis now)

Save the file.

6) Put in the full “Master System Prompt”
Open app/core/system_prompt.py.
At the top you’ll see SYSTEM_PROMPT = """ ... """.

Replace the placeholder text with the full prompt I gave you titled
“VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.1.0)” (the big block we just finalized).

Save the file.

This tells the AI exactly how ViralNOW should think and answer.

7) Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
You should see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Keep this window open. That means the app is running.

8) Check it’s alive (easy)
Open a browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see: {"ok": true}

9) Make a temporary access token
This is just a long string that says “it’s you”.

Open a second terminal window in the same folder and run:

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Copy the output (it looks like a long jumble of letters and dots). That’s your token.

10) Send your first analysis
Choose one way:

A) With curl (quick)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"media\":{\"caption\":\"I failed 3 times — then this worked.\"},\"platform_focus\":\"tiktok\"}"
(Use the same command on Mac, but remove the ^ line breaks or switch them to \.)

B) With a tiny Python script (if curl feels annoying)
Create a file named try_it.py with this content:

import requests, json
TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
payload = {"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}
r = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze",
                  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"},
                  json=payload)
print(json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2))
Run it:

python try_it.py
Success looks like: you get JSON with both hook_variations (strings) and hook_variations_tagged (objects that include pattern + text). That means A/B hook tagging works.

What each file is (plain English)
app/main.py – starts the server.

app/routers/analyze.py – the “analyze” command your app answers.

app/core/system_prompt.py – your brain (the master instructions).

.env – your secret keys and switches.

Common “uh oh” fixes
ModuleNotFoundError – you forgot step 3 (activate .venv) or step 4 (install tools).

Unauthorized or 401 – your Authorization header is missing or the token string is wrong.

Model did not return JSON – re-paste the full Master System Prompt; keep the output format strict.

Server won’t start – make sure only one app instance is running; close extra terminals or change the port (--port 8001).

What to do next (when this works)
Try your own captions or video links in the request body.

Turn on credits later for free/pro plans:

Install Redis: docker run -p 6379:6379 redis

In .env, set DISABLE_CREDITS=false, restart the server.

Add a simple web page (Next.js or any frontend) that calls POST /api/analyze and shows:

the Viral Score meter,

the hooks (with pattern badges),

the next actions button.

Paste more features from our prompt (trend radar, coach, compare) and hit the other routes (/api/trend, /api/coach, etc.).

If you hit any step and something looks weird, paste the error text here and I’ll translate it and tell you exactly what to type next.

01. WHATS SERVER APP?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8s
Great question.

What’s a “server app” (plain talk)?
It’s a program that waits for requests and sends back answers over the network.

Think of it like a restaurant kitchen: you place an order (request), it cooks (does the work), then hands you the dish (response).

In ViralNOW (what yours does)
Your server app is the FastAPI backend running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

It exposes a door called /api/analyze.

You send it a caption/video link → it talks to the AI using your Master System Prompt → it returns structured JSON with the score, hooks, fixes, etc.

Why you need it
Keeps your secret keys safe (not in the browser).

Central brain: phone, laptop, and future apps can all use the same logic.

Monetization & limits: handles credits, auth tokens, rate limits.

Scales later: you can move it from your laptop to the cloud (Render/Fly/AWS) without changing how clients talk to it.

Words decoded (no jargon)
API: the doorway you send requests through.

Endpoint: a specific door, e.g., /api/analyze.

Request: your order (what to analyze).

Response: the dish (the JSON with results).

JSON: neat, structured text the computer understands (like a clean form).

Token: your wristband proving who you are.

One-line summary
A server app is your app’s brain in the back room: it listens for requests, runs the logic (AI + rules), and sends back answers your UI (or you) can use.

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 8s
awesome — you saw {"ok": true} at /health. next steps:

1) keep the server window open
That’s your app running. Don’t close it.

2) open a second terminal in the same folder
Generate a temporary access token (your “wristband”):

Windows (PowerShell)

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Mac

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Copy the long token it prints.

3) send your first analysis request
Pick ONE method:

A) super-easy Python script
Create a file named try_it.py in the project folder with this:

import requests, json
TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

payload = {
  "media": {"caption": "I failed 3 times — then this worked."},
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}

r = requests.post(
  "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"},
  json=payload
)
print(json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2))
Run it:

python try_it.py
B) curl (if you prefer)
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
4) what a “good” result looks like
You’ll get JSON including BOTH:

hook_variations: a list of hook strings

hook_variations_tagged: objects with { "pattern": "...", "text": "..." }

If you see those, ViralNOW is working.

5) try your own stuff
Replace the caption text with yours, or

Send a real video link:

{
  "media": { "url": "https://your-video-link.mp4" },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
6) how to stop / start
Stop server: go to the server window and press Ctrl + C.

Start again:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
quick fixes
401 Unauthorized → Token missing/wrong. Re-run dev_token.py, paste it exactly.

BAD_JSON / weird output → Open app/core/system_prompt.py and paste the full VIRALNOW — MASTER SYSTEM PROMPT (v1.1.0) block we made earlier. Save, restart server.

Import/Module errors → Make sure you activated the env first:

Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Mac: source .venv/bin/activate

I DONT HAVE KEY
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
totally fine—you’ve got two paths:

A) Get a real OpenAI API key (simple)
Make/Open your OpenAI account
Go to the OpenAI Platform and sign in. 
OpenAI Platform

Create a key
In the Platform, open the API Keys page and click Create new secret key. Copy it once (you won’t see it again). 
OpenAI Help Center
+1

(If asked) Add payment
Add a payment method in Billing → Payment method (credit/debit; prepaid works). 
OpenAI Help Center

Set a budget cap (recommended)
In Usage / Limits, set a monthly budget so you don’t overspend. (Hard limits/budgets live in the Platform’s limits screen.) 
OpenAI Help Center

Paste the key into the app

Open your project’s .env file

Set: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

Save.

That’s it. Restart the server and run the test call.

Notes: Your ChatGPT Plus subscription is separate from API billing. Keys are secret—don’t share them.

B) Don’t have a key yet? Use “Mock Mode” (works right now)
You can make the API return a fake, realistic response so you can keep building and testing today.

Open app/services/openai_service.py.

Replace its contents with this:

# MOCK MODE: no OpenAI key needed

    }
Save, restart the server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Run the test request again. You’ll get a valid JSON response—no key needed.

When you’re ready to use the real AI, just paste your key into .env and restore the original openai_service.py from the ZIP (or ask me and I’ll paste it back).

Quick recap (choose one path)
Use a real key → full AI power (follow steps in A).

Use Mock Mode → build & demo today without a key (follow steps in B).

If you want, tell me which path you’re taking and your device (Windows/Mac). I’ll walk you through each click and command next.

MOCK MODE
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5s
Perfect—here’s Mock Mode in super simple, do-this-then-that steps.

(You can use the ZIP I gave you earlier: )

Mock Mode: step by step
1) Open the project folder
Unzip → open a terminal inside the folder (where requirements.txt is).

2) Turn on the project’s private environment
Windows (PowerShell)

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Mac

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Make a settings file
Copy the example and edit it:
Windows

copy .env.example .env
Mac

cp .env.example .env
Open .env and leave these as-is for Mock Mode:

DISABLE_CREDITS=true
DEV_MODE=true
(You don’t need an OpenAI key in Mock Mode.)

4) Put the app into Mock Mode
Open app/services/openai_service.py and replace everything in that file with this:

# MOCK MODE: no OpenAI key needed
import json
from typing import Any, Dict

async def analyze_with_llm(user_envelope: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Return a believable sample response so the app/UI works.
    return {
        "ok": True,
        "viral_score": 82,
        "confidence": "91%",
        "summary": "Tight hook and clean pacing; clear payoff.",
        "why_it_will_hit": "Immediate tension, readable captions, and beat-matched edits.",
        "why_it_wont_hit": "Minor lull at 0:06; CTA only appears in caption.",
        "improvement_suggestions": [
            "Trim 1.0–1.5s from intro",
            "Add on-screen CTA at 0:04",
            "Punch-in on payoff line"
        ],
        "improvement_suggestions_tagged": [
            {"text":"Trim 1.0–1.5s from intro","maps_to":"retention_0_3s"},
            {"text":"Add on-screen CTA at 0:04","maps_to":"avd"}
        ],
        "hook_variations": [
            "I did the opposite—and it worked.",
            "This myth kills your views.",
            "Give me 7 seconds."
        ],
        "hook_variations_tagged": [
            {"pattern":"contrarian","text":"I did the opposite—and it worked."},
            {"pattern":"myth_bust","text":"This myth kills your views."},
            {"pattern":"countdown","text":"Give me 7 seconds."}
        ],
        "recommended_hashtags": ["#MindsetFuel","#ViralNOW","#AIHustle","#Motivation","#CreatorTips","#Shorts"],
        "best_post_times": ["8:00 PM CST","11:00 AM CST"],
        "platform_ranking": {"TikTok":90,"YouTube":82,"Instagram":78,"X":66},
        "comparables": [{"title":"From 0 to 1 with AI","why_similar":"confession hook","delta":"+faster cuts"}],
        "next_actions": ["Export tighter intro","Schedule 8 PM CST","Share score card on profile"],
        "pro_features_used": ["comparables_plus","trend_radar"],
        "compliance_notes_applied": []
    }
Save.

5) Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Leave this window open. If it shows “running on http://127.0.0.1:8000” you’re good.

6) Check it’s alive
Open your browser → go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
7) Make a token (your “wristband”)
Open a second terminal window in the same folder and run:

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Copy the long token string it prints.

8) Send your first analysis (two easy options)
A) Using a tiny Python script
Create a file named try_it.py with this:

import requests, json
TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
payload = {"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}
r = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze",
                  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"},
                  json=payload)
print(json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2))
Run:

python try_it.py
B) Using curl
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
Success = you get JSON with both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

Change the output (for demos)
Edit the text inside analyze_with_llm(...) to show different scores, hooks, etc. Save and re-run step 5 to restart the server.

Common fixes
Server won’t start → Make sure you activated the env:

Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Mac: source .venv/bin/activate

401 Unauthorized → Your token is missing/wrong. Re-run app/scripts/dev_token.py and paste it exactly.

Nothing happens → Make sure you’re sending the request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze.

When you want real AI later
Put your real key in .env: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-....

Restore app/services/openai_service.py to the original version (the one that calls OpenAI).

Restart the server.

If you want, tell me your device (Windows/Mac), and I’ll stay with you one line at a time while you do it.

HOW DO I START THE SERVICE
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
Got you. Here’s the fastest way to start the service (Mock Mode):

1) Open a terminal in the project folder
That’s the folder with requirements.txt.

Windows: in File Explorer, click the folder’s address bar → type powershell → Enter

Mac: right-click the folder → “New Terminal at Folder”

2) Turn on the app’s private environment + install tools
Windows (PowerShell)

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
Mac

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Make the settings file (Mock Mode is already set)
Windows

copy .env.example .env
Mac

cp .env.example .env
(You can leave .env as-is for Mock Mode.)

4) Start the service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
If that says “command not found,” run:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
You’re running when you see:
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Keep this window open.

5) Check it’s alive
Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
Quick “it didn’t start” fixes
uvicorn: command not found → use python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Windows says scripts are blocked → run this once in PowerShell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
then activate again:

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Port already in use → pick another port:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001

no stress — we’ll finish this together. here’s a super literal, copy-paste guide that works even if you’re brand-new to this. pick Windows or Mac and follow exactly.

A) WINDOWS (PowerShell)
0) Open PowerShell in the project folder
In File Explorer, open the folder that has requirements.txt

Click the address bar, type powershell, press Enter

1) Check you’re in the right folder
dir
You should see files like: requirements.txt, Dockerfile, and a folder named app.

2) Create & activate the private environment, install tools
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
If PowerShell says scripts are blocked, run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
You’ll know it worked when your prompt starts with (.venv).

3) Make the settings file (for Mock Mode)
copy .env.example .env
(Leave it as is. Mock Mode doesn’t need a key.)

4) Put the app in Mock Mode
Open the file to edit:

notepad app\services\openai_service.py
Delete everything in that file

Paste this exact block, save, close Notepad:

# MOCK MODE: no OpenAI key needed

    }
5) Start the service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
If it says “command not found”, do:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Success = you see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Keep this window open.

6) Test it’s alive
Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
7) Make a token (your “wristband”)
Open a second PowerShell window in the same folder:

python app\scripts\dev_token.py
Copy the long token it prints.

                  json=payload)
print(json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2))
Run it:

python try_it.py
You should see JSON with both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

B) MAC
0) Open Terminal in the project folder
Right-click the folder → “New Terminal at Folder”

1) Check you’re in the right place
ls
You should see requirements.txt and a folder app.

2) Create & activate the private environment, install tools
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Your prompt should show (.venv).

3) Make the settings file (Mock Mode)
cp .env.example .env
4) Put the app in Mock Mode
Open the file:

open -a TextEdit app/services/openai_service.py
Delete everything inside

Paste the same Mock Mode Python block from the Windows section above

Save

5) Start the service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# or, if that fails:
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Success = Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

6) Test it’s alive

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
Should show {"ok": true}

7) Make a token
python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Copy the token.

8) Send your first analysis
Create a quick test file:

nano try_it.py
Paste the same Python test (from Windows step 8), press Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X to save/exit.
Run:

python try_it.py
If something breaks, match the error to the fix
uvicorn: command not found
→ Use: python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

PowerShell says scripts blocked
→ Run once: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

401 Unauthorized
→ Your token is missing/wrong. Re-run python app/scripts/dev_token.py, paste exactly.

Import/Module error
→ You probably didn’t activate the env.

Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Mac: source .venv/bin/activate

Port already in use
→ Start on a different port: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001

If you tell me Windows or Mac and the last thing you see on screen, I’ll give you the exact next command to type.

You said:
this isnt working 

If it says “command not found”, do:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Success = you see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Thought for 12s
No stress — we’ll fix this fast. Do these in order. I’ll give Windows and Mac commands.

0) Make sure you’re in the right folder
You should be inside the unzipped project (the one that shows requirements.txt and a folder named app).

Windows (PowerShell)

dir
Mac

ls
You should see:

requirements.txt  app/  README.md  ...
1) Turn on the project’s private environment + install tools
Windows

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
If PowerShell blocks scripts:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Mac

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
You should now see (.venv) at the start of your terminal line.

2) Confirm uvicorn & fastapi are installed
Windows

python -c "import uvicorn, fastapi; print('OK', uvicorn.__version__)"
Mac

python -c "import uvicorn, fastapi; print('OK')"
If this prints OK ..., good.

If it errors, run:

Windows: pip install uvicorn[standard] fastapi

Mac: pip install uvicorn[standard] fastapi

3) Start the service (the correct, always-works way)
Windows

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Mac

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Success looks like:

Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/health — you should see {"ok": true}.

If you still get an error, match it to the fix:
A) ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
You’re not in the project root. Move into the folder that contains the app folder:

cd PATH/TO/your/unzipped/project
Run step 3 again.

B) uvicorn: command not found
You didn’t activate the env or PATH is odd. Use the module form (we already did):

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
(If Windows still complains about python, try py -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload.)

C) Address already in use (port busy)
Start on a different port:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001 --reload
D) Still unsure if uvicorn works? Quick mini-test
Make a tiny server to prove the runner works.

Create a file named mini.py with:

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"ok": True}
Run:

python -m uvicorn mini:app --reload --port 8002
Open http://127.0.0.1:8002/health.

If this works, uvicorn is fine — the issue is just path/folder for app.main:app.

If this fails, we need to fix your Python/venv install (rare).

After the server is running
Keep that window open.

In a second terminal in the same folder:

python app/scripts/dev_token.py
Then send a test request (pick one):

Python script

import requests, json
TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
payload = {"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}
r = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze",
                  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {TOKEN}"},
                  json=payload)
print(json.dumps(r.json(), indent=2))
curl

curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"media":{"caption":"I failed 3 times — then this worked."},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
If it still fails, copy the exact first 3–5 error lines you see after running step 3 (start command) and paste them here. I’ll translate and give the exact next command to run.

Thought for 19s
The user needs help with Windows PowerShell and faced issues using curl with Unix-style backslashes. I should guide them to use PowerShell’s Invoke-WebRequest. They can also try creating a .py file for Python or use tools like HTTPie or Postman. I'll give step-by-step instructions for the PowerShell setup and JSON body example.

I'll guide the user to create a token via the Python script dev_token.py, then set the $TOKEN variable in PowerShell. Using Invoke-RestMethod, I'll show how to form the headers and body for the request. I'll note using a here-string to avoid quoting issues and offer an alternative curl.exe command if they prefer.

I'll guide the user to create a Python file called try_it.py using Notepad, and walk them through the steps to paste the code. I'll check if their virtual environment is activated, though it's not strictly necessary for requests. I'll also explain how to copy the token from the Python script output and set the variable correctly. I'll clarify the backtick issue in PowerShell and avoid any jargon. Finally, I'll remind them about Mock Mode in case they missed it.

On PowerShell, 'curl' is aliased to Invoke-WebRequest, so the syntax won't work like it would in Unix. I'll offer two solutions: using Invoke-RestMethod (native) or curl.exe (real curl). I'll show an example token capture with: $TOKEN = $(python app\scripts\dev_token.py).Trim(). Finally, I'll advise avoiding special characters like em dashes to prevent quoting problems.

Done
All good — those errors are because PowerShell isn’t the same as Mac/Linux “curl.” On Windows, use either PowerShell’s web cmdlets or call curl.exe explicitly.

Below are two copy-paste ways that work. Pick ONE.

✅ Option A (recommended): PowerShell’s native command
Make sure the server is running in the other window and shows:

Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Check: open http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → you should see {"ok": true}.

Get a token (in a new PowerShell window in the project folder):

$TOKEN = (python app\scripts\dev_token.py).Trim()
Send the request using Invoke-RestMethod:

$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should see JSON with hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

✅ Option B: Use the real curl.exe one-liner
PowerShell aliases curl to another command. Call curl.exe explicitly:

$TOKEN = (python app\scripts\dev_token.py).Trim()
curl.exe -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"media\":{\"caption\":\"I failed 3 times - then this worked.\"},\"platform_focus\":\"tiktok\"}"
Note the curl.exe and the caret ^ for line breaks (Windows).
If the caret annoys you, put it all on one single line.

If it still errors, quick checks
404 Not Found → URL typo. Must be exactly /api/analyze.

401 Unauthorized → Token missing/wrong. Re-run:

$TOKEN = (python app\scripts\dev_token.py).Trim()
Connection refused → Server not running. In the server window:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Model/JSON error (in Mock Mode) → Make sure you replaced
app\services\openai_service.py with the Mock Mode function.

Paste back the first 3–5 lines of any error you see now and I’ll tell you the exact next command to run.

Thought for 10s
You’re super close. Two things were happening:

Token command: running python app\scripts\dev_token.py makes Python look inside app\scripts first, so it can’t find the app package.
Fix: run it as a module: python -m app.scripts.dev_token.

Connection refused: the server wasn’t running when you sent the request. You need one window running the server, and a second window to make requests.

Do this exactly on Windows (PowerShell):

Window 1 — start the server
# go to your project folder
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"

# (only once) create + activate the env, install tools
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt

# start the server (leave this window open)
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
You should see: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Test in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → it should show {"ok": true}.

Window 2 — get a token and call the API
Open a new PowerShell window:

# go to the same folder and activate the env
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# ✅ IMPORTANT: run the token script as a module
$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()

# Build headers/body and call the endpoint (PowerShell-native way)
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should now see JSON with both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

If anything errors, match it quickly:
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
→ Use: python -m app.scripts.dev_token (not python app\scripts\dev_token.py)

Unable to connect to the remote server
→ Start Window 1 and make sure it shows “Uvicorn running…”, and that http://127.0.0.1:8000/health works.

401 Unauthorized
→ Re-run the token command and use the new $TOKEN value.

Paste the next error (first 3–5 lines) if you see one, and I’ll tell you the exact command to type next.

awesome — if /health shows {"ok": true}, the server is running. now let’s actually analyze something in Mock Mode.

Do this in a new PowerShell window (same folder)
Activate the env

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Get a token (important: run as a module)

$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
Send an analysis request (PowerShell-native way)

$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should see a JSON response with:

viral_score

improvement_suggestions

hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged (pattern + text)

Try your own caption
Change the caption inside $body and run steps 3 again.

If something looks off
401 Unauthorized → re-run the token command and use the new $TOKEN.

Connection error → make sure the first window is still running and /health shows {"ok": true}.

Weird output → confirm you pasted the Mock Mode function into app\services\openai_service.py exactly as given.

Want me to help you send a real video URL next or set up a quick “pretty” web page to hit this endpoint?

Thought for 7s
Seems like the 500 error may be happening because the server wasn’t running with the correct venv activated, or perhaps it's from a window that already had it activated. Also, if using the wrong response model like AnalyzeResponse, it could cause a validation error. I'll fix it by ensuring Mock Mode is installed or removing response_model typing temporarily. I'll also show how to check the logs for the exact error and step through the fix.

Done
You’re almost there. Two issues to fix:

PowerShell blocked your virtual-env activation (easy, one-line fix).

“Internal Server Error” (500) means the server crashed while handling /api/analyze — usually because Mock Mode isn’t installed or the response didn’t match the expected JSON shape.

Let’s fix both step-by-step.

A) Unblock & activate your Python env (PowerShell)
In PowerShell, run these exactly:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"

# allow scripts only for THIS window
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# create and activate the env if not already active
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
You should now see (.venv) at the start of your prompt.

If that still complains, open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and use:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
B) Make sure Mock Mode is actually in place
Open this file in Notepad:

notepad app\services\openai_service.py
Delete everything in it and paste this exact code, then Save:

# MOCK MODE: no OpenAI key needed

Why this matters: Without Mock Mode, the server calls the real OpenAI API (no key) → returns the wrong shape → FastAPI tries to fit it into the AnalyzeResponse model → 500 error.

C) Start the server (Window 1)
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Leave this window open.

Test in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → {"ok": true}

If you still see red error lines here when you call /api/analyze, copy the first 5 lines and paste them to me.

D) Call the API (Window 2)
Open a new PowerShell window (same folder), then:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# token (run as a module!)
$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()

# headers + body
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@

# send request
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Success = you see JSON with viral_score, improvement_suggestions, and both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

Still getting “Internal Server Error”?
Look at the server window (Window 1). Copy the first 5 lines of the red error text (the “Traceback”) and paste it here. I’ll translate it and give you the exact next command to run.

NOPE WERE GOOD
ChatGPT said:
Yesss 🙌 — love it. You’re up and running.

Quick next moves (pick what you want)
Try your own content

In the request body, change the caption or add a real video link:

{
  "media": { "url": "https://your-video.mp4", "caption": "Your caption here" },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
Tweak the output for demos (Mock Mode)

Edit app/services/openai_service.py → change viral_score, hooks, etc.

Restart server: Ctrl+C, then

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Switch to real AI (when ready)

Get an OpenAI API key.

Put it in .env as OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-....

Restore the original openai_service.py (the non-mock version from the zip) so it calls the model.

Enable free vs. pro credits (optional)

Install Redis:

docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
In .env, set DISABLE_CREDITS=false. Restart server.

Add a simple UI (optional)

Build a tiny web page (Next.js or anything) that POSTs to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze and renders:

Viral Score

hook_variations_tagged chips

“Next actions” list

Handy commands (Windows, PowerShell)
Activate env:

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Start server:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Make token:

$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
Send request:

$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = '{"media":{"caption":"Your text"},"platform_focus":"tiktok"}'
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
If you want, I can now generate a clean Next.js front-end that looks “simple but expensive” and connects to this API out of the box.

Thought for 8s
Got you — switching from Mock Mode to real AI needs 3 quick fixes. Do these exactly in PowerShell.

1) Make sure your app actually reads the .env file
Right now app/core/config.py doesn’t load .env, so your API key isn’t seen.

Open this file:

notepad app\core\config.py
Add the two lines shown below (ONLY the two lines with 👉):

import os
from pydantic import BaseModel
👉 from dotenv import load_dotenv
👉 load_dotenv()  # read .env into environment variables

class Settings(BaseModel):
    openai_api_key: str = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "")
    jwt_secret: str = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET", "change_me")
    jwt_alg: str = os.getenv("JWT_ALG", "HS256")
    redis_url: str = os.getenv("REDIS_URL", "redis://localhost:6379/0")
    tz_name: str = os.getenv("TZ_NAME", "America/Chicago")
    freemium_daily_credits: int = int(os.getenv("FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS", "3"))
    analyze_cost: int = int(os.getenv("ANALYZE_COST", "1"))
    disable_credits: bool = os.getenv("DISABLE_CREDITS", "true").lower() == "true"
    dev_mode: bool = os.getenv("DEV_MODE", "true").lower() == "true"

settings = Settings()
Save and close.

2) Use a known-good model name
The sample code used "gpt-5". If your account doesn’t have that, you’ll get errors. Let’s set a safe default.

Open this file:

notepad app\services\openai_service.py
Change the top to this (add the 👉 lines):

import json
from typing import Any, Dict
from openai import OpenAI
from app.core.config import settings
from app.core.system_prompt import SYSTEM_PROMPT
👉 import os

👉 MODEL = os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini")  # safe default; you can change later

client = OpenAI(api_key=settings.openai_api_key)

async def analyze_with_llm(user_envelope: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
👉     model=MODEL,
        messages=[
            {"role":"system","content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
            {"role":"user","content": json.dumps(user_envelope)}
        ],
        temperature=0.6,
    )
    content = completion.choices[0].message.content
    ...
Save and close.

Also set it in .env (optional but nice):

notepad .env
Add this line (or edit it if present):

OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
Save.

3) Check your API key format in .env
Open:

notepad .env
Make sure it looks exactly like:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
No quotes.

No spaces before/after.

One line.

Save.

4) Restart the server cleanly
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"

# allow scripts for this window
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# activate the env
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# (only if you haven’t already) install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# quick sanity check: does Python see your key?
python -c "import os; print('KEY?', bool(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')))"

# start server
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
The KEY? True line means your API key was loaded from .env.

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → {"ok": true}

5) Call /api/analyze again (real model)
Open a second PowerShell window:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should now get a real AI response (not mock), matching your system prompt’s JSON shape.

If you still hit errors, match them fast
KEY? False in step 4
→ .env isn’t being read. Re-check you added load_dotenv() in app/core/config.py, and that .env is in the project root (same folder as requirements.txt). Then restart the server.

model not found or similar
→ Change model to something your account has, e.g.
In .env: OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
Restart the server.

401 Unauthorized from OpenAI
→ Your key is wrong or has extra spaces. Fix .env, restart.

Any red traceback in the server window
→ Copy the first 5 lines and paste here. I’ll tell you the exact fix.

Want me to check your .env line-by-line? Paste just the key names (hide the key itself) and I’ll verify the structure.

You said:
do i start new PowerShell's
ChatGPT said:
Yes. Keep it simple:

How many PowerShell windows?
Window 1 = Server window. Runs the app and stays open.

Window 2 = Command window. You use this to make tokens and send requests.

You can’t use the same window for both because the server “takes over” that window until you stop it.

Exactly what to do
Window 1 — start (or keep) the server running
Open PowerShell and run:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Leave this window open. Check: visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → it should show {"ok": true}.

Window 2 — make token and call the API
Open a new PowerShell window and run:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should see a JSON response with viral_score, suggestions, and both hook_variations and hook_variations_tagged.

Quick tips
Every new PowerShell window needs activation again:

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
To open a second window quickly, you can run this from Window 1:

Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList '-NoExit','-Command','cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"; Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1'
If anything errors, paste the first 3–5 lines here and I’ll tell you the exact next command.

ChatGPT said:
No problem—this is just a file/location thing. Let’s fix “.env not found” on Windows step-by-step.

1) Make sure you’re in the right folder
This must be the folder that contains requirements.txt and the app folder.

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
dir
You should see: requirements.txt, .env.example, app\, etc.

2) Create the .env file (two easy ways)
Option A — copy the example
copy .env.example .env
Option B — create from scratch
@'
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key-here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
JWT_SECRET=change_me
JWT_ALG=HS256
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
DEV_MODE=true
'@ | Out-File -Encoding ascii .env
If you used Notepad before: it might have saved as .env.txt. Fix it:

ren ".env.txt" ".env"
Show hidden extensions so you can see if it’s .env.txt:

File Explorer → View → File name extensions (check it)

3) Put your real API key in the file
Open and edit:

notepad .env
Make sure these lines exist (no quotes, no extra spaces):

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
Save and close.

4) Ensure Python actually reads .env
We added this earlier—confirm it exists in app\core\config.py:

notepad app\core\config.py
Near the top you should see:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
If not, add those two lines under the imports. Save.

5) Verify the app can see your .env
Activate your env and run a quick check:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -c "import os, pathlib; print('CWD:', pathlib.Path().resolve()); print('.env exists?', (pathlib.Path('.env').exists())); print('KEY loaded?', bool(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))); print('MODEL:', os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL'))"
You want:

CWD: pointing at ...\ViralNOW_API_starter

.env exists? True

KEY loaded? True

MODEL: gpt-4o-mini

If KEY loaded? False:

You’re not in the correct folder, or

.env isn’t named correctly, or

load_dotenv() is missing.

Fix and re-run the check.

6) Restart the server (clean)
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/health → should show {"ok": true}.

7) Call /api/analyze again (in a second window)
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Still says “can’t find .env”?
Send me the output of this command:

dir -Force

Good news: your check is fine. That KEY loaded? False is only because your short Python test didn’t call load_dotenv(). The app will load .env at runtime if we add two lines in config.py. Let’s verify those and then prove the key loads.

Do these exact PowerShell commands
1) Confirm config.py loads .env
Open the file:

notepad app\core\config.py
At the top, under the imports, make sure these two lines exist (add them if missing), then Save:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # read .env into environment variables
2) Make sure python-dotenv is installed
pip show python-dotenv
If it shows details, you’re good.

If it says “WARNING: Package(s) not found”, install:

pip install python-dotenv
3) Check your .env contents & format
Get-Content -Raw .env
You should see lines like (no quotes, no spaces before/after =):

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
JWT_SECRET=change_me
JWT_ALG=HS256
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
DEV_MODE=true
If you see OPENAI_API_KEY with quotes or spaces, fix with:

notepad .env
…then Save.

4) Quick proof that the key loads when load_dotenv() is called
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); import os; print('KEY?', bool(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))); print('MODEL:', os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL'))"
You want:

KEY? True
MODEL: gpt-4o-mini
5) Restart the server cleanly
In Window 1 (server window):

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/health and confirm {"ok": true}.

6) Call /api/analyze (Window 2)
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should now get a real AI response.
If anything goes red in the server window, copy the first 5 lines and I’ll give you the exact fix.

model says none on 4. quick proof
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
No worries — “MODEL: None” just means the OPENAI_MODEL line isn’t being read from .env. Two easy ways to fix it:

Option 1 (recommended): Don’t rely on .env for the model
Make the code use a safe default even if the env var is missing.

Open this file:

notepad app\services\openai_service.py
At the top, make sure it looks exactly like this (notice the fallback):

import json
from typing import Any, Dict
from openai import OpenAI
from app.core.config import settings
from app.core.system_prompt import SYSTEM_PROMPT
import os

MODEL = os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL") or "gpt-4o-mini"  # <= fallback if env not set

client = OpenAI(api_key=settings.openai_api_key)
Save.

Now even if OPENAI_MODEL is missing, it will use gpt-4o-mini.

Option 2: Set OPENAI_MODEL properly in .env
If you want the quick proof to show the model:

Show your current .env:

Get-Content -Raw .env
If you don’t see a clean line like this, add it:

OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
(Exactly like that: no quotes, no spaces around =.)

If it’s missing, append it safely:

Add-Content .env "`nOPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini"
Re-run the proof command (note it loads dotenv inside the test):

python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); import os; print('MODEL:', os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL'))"
You want:

MODEL: gpt-4o-mini
Restart and test for real

ChatGPT said:
Nice. Since you’re set, here are the next 4 moves—short and concrete.

1) Run a real test (your own text or link)
PowerShell (Window 2)

$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { 
    "url": "https://your-video-file-or-hosted-link.mp4",
    "caption": "Your exact caption here"
  },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
$response | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
2) Save a “one-liner” you can reuse
Create call_analyze.ps1 in the project folder with:

param([string]$caption = "I failed 3 times - then this worked.")
$TOKEN = (python -m app.scripts.dev_token).Trim()
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @"
{ "media": { "caption": "$caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
"@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Run it any time:

.\call_analyze.ps1 -caption "New hook idea..."
3) Enable free vs. pro credits (optional)
Start Redis (once):

docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
Edit .env → set DISABLE_CREDITS=false

Restart server:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
4) Deploy later (Render—easy path)
When ready to share:

Push this repo to GitHub.

On Render.com → “New Web Service”

Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Add environment variables from your .env (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.)

If you want a simple UI that hits /api/analyze and shows score + hook chips, say “front-end MVP” and I’ll generate a drop-in Next.js page.

You said:
Error: Option '--port' requires an argument.
ChatGPT said:
That error means you ran --port without giving it a number (or you used $PORT in PowerShell where it’s empty). Here’s the quick fix:

If you’re running locally (PowerShell on Windows)
Use a real number:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
(You can change 8000 to 8001 etc.)

If you copied a cloud command like --port $PORT
In PowerShell, $PORT is usually empty → causes your error.

Either set it, or just use a number:

Option A (set the env var then use it):

$env:PORT = 8000
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port $env:PORT --reload
Option B (simpler: just hardcode a number):

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
If you’re deploying on Render/Heroku/Fly
Those platforms inject a PORT env var automatically. Use their shell style on the platform, not locally:

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
(Works on Linux containers there; don’t run that command on your Windows PowerShell.)

Quick sanity check
After starting, visit:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
If you still get an error, paste the exact command you ran and the first 2–3 error lines, and I’ll give the exact correction.

You said:
nvm i got it. will then free version be ok
ChatGPT said:
Nice—glad it’s running!

Short answer: Yes, you can use a “free” setup right now, but there are two meanings of “free,” so pick what you want:

Option A — Truly free (no AI costs): Mock Mode
Pros: $0 cost, perfect for demos and UI building.

Cons: Results are fake (sample data).

How: keep app/services/openai_service.py in Mock Mode OR switch back anytime.

Best for: building the UI/flow, pitching the concept.

Option B — Real AI but control spend (cheap)
OpenAI’s API generally requires a paid key (pay-as-you-go), but you can keep costs tiny.

Do this to make it safe:

In .env set a small model:

OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
In your OpenAI account, set a low monthly budget/limit (e.g., $5).

Keep /analyze requests short (no huge transcripts).

Pros: real outputs; still low cost.

Cons: not $0 (just very small).

Your app’s Free tier for users (recommended defaults)
Even if you don’t charge users yet, set these now so you’re future-proof:

.env

DISABLE_CREDITS=false        # turn on credits logic
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3     # 3 free analyses per day
ANALYZE_COST=1               # each /analyze costs 1 credit
Run Redis:

docker run -p 6379:6379 redis
Result: users can use the app “free” up to 3/day; you cap your OpenAI costs.

What I’d do, step-by-step
Build with Mock Mode until your UI feels great. ($0)

Flip to real AI with gpt-4o-mini, set a $5 monthly cap in your OpenAI dashboard.

Turn on credits (DISABLE_CREDITS=false) so users get 3/day. This makes your “free version” clear and safe.

When ready, add Pro for unlimited + trend radar.

If you tell me how you want to run (Mock only, or real AI with a tiny budget), I’ll give you the exact toggles/commands to set it up.

for joiwwhat do you meran add environment vartiables
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Totally fair question. “Environment variables” are just named settings the app reads at startup (like your API key, model name, etc.). You don’t hard-code secrets in files—you store them in env vars.

Here’s how to add them for your setup on Windows and for cloud later.

What you need for ViralNOW
Common ones we use:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # your real key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini        # safe default
DISABLE_CREDITS=true|false      # true = no Redis needed
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
JWT_SECRET=change_me
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
The 3 ways to set them
1) Best for this project: .env file (we already wired this)
Your app loads .env automatically via load_dotenv().

Create/edit the file in your project root (same folder as requirements.txt):

notepad .env
Put each setting on its own line, no quotes, no spaces around =:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
JWT_SECRET=change_me
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
Save. Restart the server so it re-reads .env.

Verify it’s loaded:

python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); import os; print(os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL'))"
You should see gpt-4o-mini.

2) Per-terminal (temporary): PowerShell env var
This only lasts for that window.

$env:OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
Then start the server from the same window:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
Check:

python -c "import os; print(os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL'))"
3) System-wide (not needed now)
Windows Settings → System → About → Advanced system settings → Environment Variables.
Add a User variable named OPENAI_API_KEY with your key. (You must reopen terminals after this.)

Cloud later (Render / Heroku / Fly)
Every platform has a place to add env vars in the dashboard:

Render: Service → Environment → “Add Environment Variable” (add OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL, etc.). Start command there should be:

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Heroku: Settings → Config Vars → Reveal Config Vars → add keys/values.

Fly.io: fly secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-....

Common gotchas
Don’t put quotes: OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." ❌
Use: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... ✅

No spaces: OPENAI_MODEL = gpt-4o-mini ❌
Use: OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini ✅

Restart the server after changing .env.

Make sure app/core/config.py has:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
Quick checklist for you (copy/paste)
cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
notepad .env   # add / edit vars, save
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -c "from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); import os; print('MODEL:', os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL')); print('KEY?', bool(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')))"
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
If you paste the output of that python -c ... check (last two prints), I’ll confirm everything’s set perfectly.

in render
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
Perfect—here’s exactly how to get ViralNOW running on Render and how to add the environment variables there.

Deploy to Render (step-by-step)
1) Put the code on GitHub
Create a new GitHub repo.

Copy the project folder contents (the one with requirements.txt, app/, etc.) into the repo and push.

2) Create a Render Web Service
Go to Render → New → Web Service → connect your GitHub repo.

Branch: your main branch.

Region: pick one near you.

Runtime: Native (not Docker) to keep it simple.

Build Command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command:

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
That $PORT is provided by Render at runtime. Do not hardcode 8000 here.

3) Add Environment Variables in Render
Render doesn’t read your local .env file. You add variables in the dashboard:

In your service → Settings tab → Environment → Add Environment Variable.

Add these (copy exactly, one per line):

Minimum to run real AI

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
If/when you want the free tier with daily credits

DISABLE_CREDITS=false
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
…and you must also provide Redis (see next step).

4) (Optional) Add Redis on Render
If you plan to use credits (DISABLE_CREDITS=false):

Render dashboard → New → Redis → create an instance.

After it’s created, copy its Internal Connection String (something like redis://red-xxxxx:6379).

In your Web Service Environment section, add:

REDIS_URL=redis://red-xxxxx:6379
Save; Render will redeploy automatically.

5) Deploy / see logs
Click Create Web Service (or Manual Deploy).

Watch Logs; wait for “Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:XXXXX”.

Open your public URL → add /health at the end:

https://your-render-url.onrender.com/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
How to call /api/analyze on Render
/api/analyze needs a Bearer token. Generate one locally using the same JWT_SECRET you set on Render.

Windows (PowerShell)
# Replace the secret with the exact JWT_SECRET you set on Render
$SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = r'''change_me_to_a_long_random_string'''
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Copy the printed token to $TOKEN:

$TOKEN = "PASTE_THE_TOKEN_STRING_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times - then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://your-render-url.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
(You can do the same on Mac/Terminal with python and curl.)

Common Render gotchas (and quick fixes)
Error: Option --port requires an argument
You used a local command. On Render, always use --port $PORT.

ModuleNotFoundError: app
Your project root on Render isn’t correct. Ensure the repo’s root contains app/ and requirements.txt (don’t nest another folder inside). In Render Settings → Build & Deploy → Root Directory, leave it blank unless your code lives in a subfolder.

401 Unauthorized from /api/analyze
Your token was made with a different JWT_SECRET. Recreate the token locally using the same secret that’s set in Render.

401/403 from OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY missing or wrong. Fix the key in Render’s Environment. (No quotes, no spaces.)

Stuck on “Deploying…”
Check Logs → if it can’t install, ensure requirements.txt is present and valid.

500 Internal Server Error
Look at Logs to see the traceback. Common causes:

Missing OPENAI_API_KEY or wrong model name.

Your system prompt JSON contract broken. (Paste the correct full prompt into app/core/system_prompt.py locally and redeploy.)

Minimal checklist (copy this)
GitHub repo has requirements.txt, app/, app/main.py.

Render → New Web Service → Build: pip install -r requirements.txt → Start:
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Add env vars on Render:

OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini, JWT_SECRET, TZ_NAME=America/Chicago, DISABLE_CREDITS=true

Open https://your-render-url.onrender.com/health → see {"ok": true}

Make a token locally with your Render JWT_SECRET → call /api/analyze.

If you want, paste your Render logs’ first 10 lines after a failed deploy, and I’ll pinpoint the exact fix.

You said:
i dont see redis on render
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Totally normal—you have a few ways to add “Redis” on Render. If you don’t see a button literally called “Redis,” look for Key Value (it’s Redis-compatible), or use an external provider.

Your three workable options
1) Render Key Value (managed, Redis-compatible) — easiest
In Render: New → Key Value (this is their Redis-compatible store).

After it creates, copy the connection string.

In your Web Service → Environment → add:

REDIS_URL=redis://<the-connection-string-they-give-you>
DISABLE_CREDITS=false
Redeploy. Your app already does redis.Redis.from_url(settings.redis_url), so it just works. 
Render

2) Run Redis as a Private Service (Docker) on Render
Use Render’s example repo to spin up a Redis container as a Private Service.

It exposes an internal URL only your app can reach (e.g., redis://sidekiq-redis:6379).

Put that value in your Web Service env:

REDIS_URL=redis://sidekiq-redis:6379
DISABLE_CREDITS=false
Redeploy. 
GitHub

3) Use an external serverless Redis (Upstash, etc.)
Create a Redis DB on Upstash.

Copy the redis:// (or rediss://) endpoint and token.

In Render Web Service env:

REDIS_URL=rediss://:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>
DISABLE_CREDITS=false
Redeploy. (Upstash has guides for using Render.) 
Upstash: Serverless Data Platform
+1

Where to add env vars on Render
Service → Environment → Add Environment Variable. You can also “Add from .env”. Save to trigger a redeploy. 
Render

Quick checklist (after you pick an option)
In Render Web Service → Environment:

DISABLE_CREDITS=false

REDIS_URL=... (from Key Value / Private Redis / Upstash)

Click Save (Render redeploys).

In your logs, confirm no Redis errors.

Test a call that spends credits (e.g., /api/analyze) twice; the third should fail if you set FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=2, proving credit gating works.

If you tell me which path you prefer (Key Value vs. Docker Redis vs. Upstash), I’ll give you the exact clicks and the precise REDIS_URL format for that choice.

im confuised - i started new web thikg, then went to key value and eveerythigns gone. stiul have the key valur but thats it
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
You didn’t lose anything — Render just shows separate services.
Your Web Service (the FastAPI app) is one resource.
Your Key Value (Redis-compatible store) is a second resource.
We just need to connect them.

Here’s the simplest path:

Quick fix (2–minute hookup)
Open your Key Value service in Render.

Find the Connection string / Internal URL.

It will look like redis://... or rediss://....

Click the copy button.

Open your Web Service (the one with your app).
Go to Settings → Environment → Add Environment Variable and add:

REDIS_URL = <paste the connection string>

DISABLE_CREDITS = false (turns on credit gating)

(Optional but nice, if not set already)

FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS = 3

ANALYZE_COST = 1

Save → Render will redeploy your Web Service.

After deploy, open your Web Service Logs. You want to see no Redis errors at startup.

Test that credits work:

Make a token locally using the same JWT_SECRET you set on Render:

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # use your Render JWT_SECRET
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Call your live endpoint (replace the URL):

$TOKEN = "PASTE_THE_PRINTED_TOKEN"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Run it multiple times. With FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3, the 4th call should fail with 402 Not enough daily credits. That means Redis is wired and credits work.

Why “everything looked gone”
On Render, when you click into Key Value, you’re in that resource’s page. Your Web Service is still there — just back out to Dashboard or click Services and select your Web Service again. They’re separate tiles.

If you don’t want credits yet (easiest mode)
Skip Key Value/Redis entirely:

In your Web Service Environment, set:

DISABLE_CREDITS = true

Save → redeploy.

Your app works without Redis; no daily limits (good for early testing).

Quick checklist (copy/paste)
Web Service → Environment:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
DISABLE_CREDITS=false
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
REDIS_URL=redis://<paste-from-Key-Value>
Start command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Stuck? Tell me:

cabnt find thr web service
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 5s
No worries—on Render it’s easy to get “lost” between services. Here’s the exact click-path to find (or recreate) your Web Service.

First: try to find it
Go to render.com and log in.

Top-left, click your account/team switcher. Make sure you’re on the same team you used earlier (many people have “Personal” and one or more team spaces).

Click Dashboard → All Services (or the Services item in the left sidebar).

You should see tiles. Your things will look like:

Web Service: small globe icon + your repo name (e.g., viralnow-api)

Key Value: database/stack icon + the name you chose

If you see only Key Value, the Web Service was never created (or it’s in another team). That’s fine—just create it now (below).

If you don’t see it: create the Web Service again (safe)
You won’t lose the Key Value store.

Click New → Web Service.

Connect GitHub → pick the repo that has your code (root must contain requirements.txt and the app/ folder).

Fill in:

Environment: Native

Region: pick near you

Build Command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command:

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Click Create Web Service. It will deploy and open Logs.

Add environment variables (same page → Settings → Environment)
Add these (one per line):

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
Click Save (it redeploys).

Later, if you want credit-gating:

Set DISABLE_CREDITS=false

Add FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3 and ANALYZE_COST=1

Add REDIS_URL= (paste from your Key Value service’s connection string)

Save → redeploy

How to connect the Key Value you already created
Open your Key Value service → copy the Connection string (it looks like redis://... or rediss://...).

Open your Web Service → Settings → Environment and add:

REDIS_URL=<paste the connection string>
DISABLE_CREDITS=false
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
Save → redeploy. Done.

How to confirm it’s live
On your Web Service Overview, copy the public URL (like https://your-app.onrender.com).

Open <that-URL>/health in your browser → you should see:

{"ok": true}
If you still “can’t find” it
Make sure you’re on the right team (top-left switcher).

Use the Search bar on the Dashboard and type your repo/service name.

Check your GitHub repo is public/private but still connected to Render (Reconnect if needed in Render’s “Connect Account”).

Want me to sanity-check?
Tell me:

The team name shown at top-left in Render

What you see under Dashboard → All Services (just the names)

Whether you want credits OFF (simpler) or credits ON with Key Value

I’ll give you the exact next clicks and values to enter.

error when deploy

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 7s
That error means Render can’t see the app folder from where it’s starting. Easy fix—point Render at the right folder (or move the files up). Pick ONE of these paths:

Option A (most common): Your code is inside a subfolder
Your GitHub repo probably looks like this:

your-repo/
  ViralNOW_API_starter/
    app/
    requirements.txt
    ...
Render is starting at the repo root, so app isn’t found.

Fix (Render settings)
In your Web Service on Render → Settings → Build & Deploy.

Find Root Directory. Set it to the subfolder name, likely:

ViralNOW_API_starter
Save (or click Update), then Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Keep:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Render will now build/run inside that subfolder, where app/ exists.

Option B: Put the code at the repo root
Make your repo look like this:

your-repo/
  app/
  requirements.txt
  README.md
  ...
How:

Move everything out of ViralNOW_API_starter/ up to the repo root.

Commit & push.

On Render → Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Root Directory should be blank (default). Same build/start commands as above.

Quick sanity checks (before redeploy)
In GitHub, open the repo and confirm that the folder shown in Render’s “Root Directory” contains:

app/

requirements.txt

Ensure app/__init__.py exists (empty file is fine).

Start Command must reference app.main:app exactly (all lowercase):

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
If it still fails after this
Copy the first 10 lines of the Render build/run logs and your Root Directory value, and I’ll tell you exactly what to change.

You said:
==> Service Root Directory "/opt/render/project/src/ViralNOW_API_starter" is missing.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Got it — Render is telling you the Root Directory path you set doesn’t exist in the repo it’s building.

Here’s the quick fix.

What happened
You told Render to build from:

/opt/render/project/src/ViralNOW_API_starter
…but in your GitHub repo, that folder doesn’t exist (maybe it’s named differently, or you moved files). Render only knows paths inside your repo.

How to fix (pick ONE path)
Option A — Point Render to the correct folder
Open your repo on GitHub in a browser.

Look at the exact layout. Find the folder that contains both app/ and requirements.txt.

If they’re in the repo root → the path is blank (no root directory).

If they’re in a subfolder (e.g., ViralNOW_API_starter-main or backend) → copy that exact folder name.

Render → your Web Service → Settings → Build & Deploy → Root Directory:

Set it to the relative path from repo root (e.g., backend), or leave blank if files are at the repo root.

Click Save (or Update).

Click Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Example:
If your repo looks like:

your-repo/
  ViralNOW_API_starter-main/
    app/
    requirements.txt
Then set Root Directory to:

ViralNOW_API_starter-main
Option B — Move code to the repo root (simplest)
In your local project, move everything (the app/ folder, requirements.txt, etc.) up to the top of the repo.

your-repo/
  app/
  requirements.txt
  README.md
Commit & push.

In Render Root Directory → leave it blank.

Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Double-check these after you fix the path
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Files in Root Directory (the one Render uses) include:

app/ (with __init__.py and main.py inside app/)

requirements.txt

Quick sanity test
In your repo on GitHub, open the folder you set as Root Directory and confirm you can see both requirements.txt and app/. If you can’t, the path is wrong.

If you paste your GitHub repo tree (top 2 levels) or a screenshot of it, I’ll tell you the exact Root Directory string to use.

You said:
i dont understand
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Totally get it — “Root Directory” is confusing the first time. Here’s the super simple way to fix it.

What “Root Directory” means (one line)
On Render, Root Directory = the folder inside your GitHub repo that contains requirements.txt and the app folder. Render will build/run from that folder.

Do this (2-minute fix)
Step 1 — Look in your GitHub repo
Open your repo on github.com in your browser.

On the first page (top level), do you see both:

a file named requirements.txt

a folder named app

If YES:

Your Root Directory should be empty (leave it blank on Render).
Jump to Step 3.

If NO:

Click the folder you do see (e.g., ViralNOW_API_starter, backend, etc.).

Inside that folder, do you now see requirements.txt and app together?

If yes, copy the exact folder name you just clicked (e.g., ViralNOW_API_starter).

If you had to click through two folders, copy the path like outer/inner.

Examples:

If your repo shows ViralNOW_API_starter/ and inside it you see requirements.txt + app/, then the Root Directory is:

ViralNOW_API_starter
If you had to click project/backend/ to see them, then Root Directory is:

project/backend
Step 2 — Set it on Render
Go to your Web Service on Render → Settings → Build & Deploy.

Find Root Directory.

Enter exactly what you found in Step 1:

Blank if the files are at the repo top level, or

The exact folder or folder/path (e.g., ViralNOW_API_starter or project/backend).

Click Save (or Update).

Step 3 — Redeploy cleanly
In the same service, click Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Step 4 — Make sure the other two fields are right
Build Command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command:

uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
Step 5 — Test
When it finishes, open your service URL and add /health, e.g.:

https://your-app.onrender.com/health
You should see:

{"ok": true}
Quick checklist (copy/paste)
Root Directory points to the folder that shows both requirements.txt and app/ on GitHub.

Build: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

If you want, tell me what you see on the first page of your GitHub repo (just the folder/file names), and I’ll reply with the exact string you should put in Root Directory.

fastapi[all] 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Gotcha—fastapi[all] is just a shortcut for installing FastAPI plus a bunch of optional, nice-to-have packages (parsers, serializers, forms, templating, email validator, etc.). It’s handy for local dev, but not required.

What it actually does (plain)
fastapi = the core framework.

fastapi[all] = fastapi + optional extras like:

python-multipart (file uploads / forms)

jinja2 (templates)

orjson/ujson (faster JSON)

email-validator, pydantic-extra-types, pyyaml, itsdangerous, etc.

You said:
thATS THE ONLY FOLDER IN FREQUIRMENTS
ChatGPT said:
Ah—that explains a lot. If your requirements.txt only has fastapi[all], you’re missing several packages the app needs (like uvicorn, openai, python-dotenv, etc.). Let’s fix it.

What to put in requirements.txt
Open requirements.txt and replace everything with this:

fastapi>=0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.0
pydantic>=2.8.0
python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
redis>=5.0.0
httpx>=0.27.0
openai>=1.40.0
orjson>=3.10.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.1
requests>=2.31.0
Why these?
uvicorn: runs the server.

openai: talks to the AI.

python-dotenv: loads your .env (API key, etc.).

python-jose: makes your auth token.

redis: optional credits system (ok to leave in even if disabled).

orjson/httpx/requests: speed + HTTP.

If you’re running locally (Windows)
Activate your env:

cd "C:\Users\psell\Documents\APP VIRALNOW\ViralNOW_API_starter"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Install the updated requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Start the server:

python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
If you’re deploying on Render
Commit and push the updated requirements.txt to GitHub.

In Render Web Service:

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Root Directory: must point to the folder that contains both requirements.txt and the app/ folder (leave blank if they’re at the repo top level).

Click Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

If you paste your requirements.txt after updating (just the lines), I’ll sanity-check it. If Render still errors, share the first 10 log lines and I’ll give the exact fix.

That error means Render is looking in the wrong folder. You told Render the Root Directory is ViralNOW_API_starter, but that folder doesn’t exist in your repo.

Here’s the fix—super literal:

Step 1 — Look at your GitHub repo layout
Open your repo: github.com/pseller1234-create/GOVIRALL.

On the first page (top level), check what you see.

Case A (best): You see requirements.txt and the app/ folder right there.
→ Then your Root Directory must be blank (empty).

Case B: You see a folder (e.g., backend/ or ViralNOW_API_starter-main/), and inside that folder you see requirements.txt and app/.
→ Your Root Directory must be that EXACT folder path, e.g.:

backend

ViralNOW_API_starter-main

project/server (if nested 2 levels, include both: outer/inner)

Important: The Root Directory must be the path (from repo root) to the folder that contains both requirements.txt and app/.

Step 2 — Set the correct Root Directory on Render
Go to your Web Service → Settings → Build & Deploy.

In Root Directory:

Leave it blank if files are at repo top level (Case A), or

Put the exact folder name/path you found (Case B).
(Not /opt/render/... — that’s Render’s internal path; you must use your repo’s folder name, e.g. ViralNOW_API_starter-main.)

Click Save/Update.

Step 3 — Redeploy cleanly
Click Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Step 4 — Make sure these 2 fields are correct
Build Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command:
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Quick sanity check before redeploy
Open the folder you set as Root Directory on GitHub. You must see:

a file requirements.txt

a folder app/ (and inside it there is main.py etc.)

If either is missing in that folder, Render will fail with No module named 'app'.

If you’re unsure which case you have
Reply with the top-level items you see in your repo (just list the file/folder names that appear on the first GitHub page). I’ll tell you the exact Root Directory string to put in Render.

Great—your screenshot helps. In that repo there is no app/ folder. You have:

main.py

requirements.txt

render.yaml (from Render’s example)

So Render should NOT use app.main:app or a Root Directory. Do this:

Fix your Render settings (2 quick edits)
Root Directory: leave it blank (empty).

Settings → Build & Deploy → Root Directory → (clear it)

Commands:

Build Command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command:
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Click Save/Update, then Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

That will boot from your main.py at the repo root.

If your main.py isn’t a FastAPI app yet
Overwrite main.py with this minimal working server (keeps things simple and includes a mock /api/analyze so you can test immediately):

# main.py — minimal FastAPI app for Render root layout
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from typing import Optional
import json
import os

app = FastAPI(title="ViralNOW API (Root Layout)")

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"ok": True}

# very light JWT check (dev-only)
def get_user_from_auth(authorization: Optional[str]):
    if not authorization or not authorization.lower().startswith("bearer "):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing or bad token")
    return {"user_id": "demo-user", "tier": "free"}

@app.post("/api/analyze")
async def analyze(payload: dict, authorization: Optional[str] = Header(None)):
    _ = get_user_from_auth(authorization)

    # If you have a real key set, you could call OpenAI here.
    # To keep it dead-simple, we return a realistic mock.
    return JSONResponse({

    })
Commit & push, then redeploy on Render with the Start Command above.

Environment variables on Render (minimum)
In your Web Service → Settings → Environment, add:

OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini     # even if you mock, it's fine to set
JWT_SECRET=change_me_long    # used to mint your local dev token
TZ_NAME=America/Chicago
DISABLE_CREDITS=true         # simpler for now (no Redis needed)
(When you want real AI: add OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... and switch your endpoint code to call OpenAI.)

Test after deploy
Open your Render URL in a browser with /health:

https://YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com/health
Should return {"ok": true}.

Generate a token locally (use the same JWT_SECRET you set on Render):

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, "change_me_long", algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Call your live /api/analyze:

$TOKEN = "PASTE_TOKEN"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should get the JSON with hooks and tags.

Summary of the fix you needed
Your repo uses root layout (no app/ folder), so:

Root Directory: blank

Start Command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

If you prefer to use the full ViralNOW project structure later (with app/routers, credits, etc.), we can migrate your repo to that layout in one shot—just say “convert repo to ViralNOW layout” and I’ll give you a ready-to-commit file set.

That error is just a typo in requirements.txt: two package names got glued together.

Fix it (2 mins)
Edit requirements.txt in your repo and replace everything with this—one package per line:

fastapi>=0.115.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.30.0
pydantic>=2.8.0
python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
redis>=5.0.0
httpx>=0.27.0
openai>=1.40.0
orjson>=3.10.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.1
requests>=2.31.0
Commit & push to GitHub.

In Render (your Web Service):

Root Directory: leave blank (your repo root has main.py)

Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start Command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Click Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Test: open https://YOUR-SERVICE.onrender.com/health → should show {"ok": true}.

(Optional, but helpful)
If you hit weird build issues on Python 3.13, pin a stable version:

Add a file runtime.txt at repo root with:

python-3.11.9
Commit & push, then redeploy (Clear cache again).

If the next deploy fails, paste the first 10 lines of the Render build log and I’ll pinpoint the fix.

Thought for 6s
Huge win — it’s LIVE! 🎉
That 404 Not Found on / is normal because we didn’t define a homepage.

Quick test (no code)
Open:  → should show {"ok": true}

Open:  → FastAPI’s UI.

If you see /api/analyze there, you can test it right in the browser.

Send a real request (PowerShell)
Generate a token using the same JWT_SECRET you set on Render:

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, "change_me_to_a_long_random_string", algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Copy the printed token, then:

$TOKEN = "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Don’t see /api/analyze in /docs?
That means your current main.py doesn’t have that route yet. Paste this minimal working app into main.py, commit, and redeploy:

# main.py — minimal ViralNOW API at repo root
from fastapi import FastAPI, Header, HTTPException

Render settings (confirm):

Build: pip install -r requirements.txt

Start: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Root Directory: blank

Env vars on Render (minimum)
In the Web Service → Settings → Environment:

JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
DISABLE_CREDITS=true
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini   # optional for now
(Only add OPENAI_API_KEY once you switch from mock to real AI.)

Need me to wire in the real OpenAI call next or generate a tiny “expensive-looking” web page that hits this API?

THINK ITSD WORKING
ChatGPT said:
YES! That screenshot means your API is live and the routes are showing correctly. 🎉

Here’s how to use it right now and what to do next:

1) Call /api/analyze from the browser (Swagger)
Open: https://govirall.onrender.com/docs

Click Authorize (top-right) → paste: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

To get a token (run locally on your computer):

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # must match JWT_SECRET on Render
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Copy the printed token and use it in Swagger (with the Bearer prefix).

Expand POST /api/analyze → Try it out → paste a body:

{
  "media": { "caption": "I failed 3 times — then this worked." },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
Execute → you should get the JSON with viral_score, hooks, etc.

2) Call it from PowerShell (quick)
$TOKEN = "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
3) What you have right now
A live FastAPI service on Render.

/health works.

/api/analyze returns a mock (demo) response — perfect for testing UI and flow.

4) When you want real AI outputs
In Render → Settings → Environment add/update:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # your real key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini       # safe default
DISABLE_CREDITS=true           # keep simple for now
Then update your main.py to call OpenAI instead of returning the mock (I can paste you a drop-in version when you’re ready). Redeploy.

5) Optional: turn on free/pro credits
Create Render Key Value (Redis-compatible) or use Upstash Redis.

In Web Service → Environment:

DISABLE_CREDITS=false
REDIS_URL=redis://...        # paste from your Key Value/Upstash
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
Redeploy. Now free users get 3/day.

6) Want a simple, “expensive-looking” UI next?
Say “ship the frontend MVP” and I’ll give you a drop-in Next.js page that:

hits https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze

shows the Viral Score, tagged hooks (pattern + text), next actions

uses clean, luxury-minimal styling

If anything hiccups (401/500), tell me the first 3–5 lines of the error from the response or Render logs and I’ll fix it fast.

I DONT SEE AUTGORIZE
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6s
Totally normal — the Authorize button only appears if the API defines a security scheme. Our minimal server didn’t, so Swagger hides it.

You’ve got two choices:

Option A — Call it now (no Swagger auth button)
Use PowerShell (works today):

$TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_JWT"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Option B — Add the Authorize button to Swagger (quick patch)
Edit main.py in your repo and replace it with this version (adds Bearer security so the button shows):

# main.py — ViralNOW API (with Swagger "Authorize" button)
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI(title="ViralNOW API (Root Layout)")

# --- Security (adds the Authorize button) ---
security = HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)

def require_bearer(creds: Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials] = Depends(security)):
    if not creds or not creds.scheme.lower() == "bearer" or not creds.credentials:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing or bad token")
    # TODO: verify JWT if you want (using your JWT_SECRET)
    return {"user_id": "demo-user", "tier": "free"}

# --- Routes ---
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"ok": True}

@app.post("/api/analyze")
async def analyze(payload: dict, _user = Depends(require_bearer)):
    # mock response; swap for real OpenAI when ready
    return JSONResponse({
        "ok": True,
        "viral_score": 82,
        "confidence": "91%",
        "summary": "Tight hook and clean pacing; clear payoff.",
        "why_it_will_hit": "Immediate tension, readable captions, beat-matched edits.",
        "why_it_wont_hit": "Minor lull at 0:06; CTA only in caption.",
        "improvement_suggestions": [
            "Trim 1.0–1.5s from intro",
            "Add on-screen CTA at 0:04",
            "Punch-in on payoff line"
        ],
        "improvement_suggestions_tagged": [
            {"text":"Trim 1.0–1.5s from intro","maps_to":"retention_0_3s"},
            {"text":"Add on-screen CTA at 0:04","maps_to":"avd"}
        ],
        "hook_variations": [
            "I did the opposite—and it worked.",
            "This myth kills your views.",
            "Give me 7 seconds."
        ],
        "hook_variations_tagged": [
            {"pattern":"contrarian","text":"I did the opposite—and it worked."},
            {"pattern":"myth_bust","text":"This myth kills your views."},
            {"pattern":"countdown","text":"Give me 7 seconds."}
        ],
        "recommended_hashtags": ["#MindsetFuel","#ViralNOW","#AIHustle","#Motivation","#CreatorTips","#Shorts"],
        "best_post_times": ["8:00 PM CST","11:00 AM CST"],
        "platform_ranking": {"TikTok":90,"YouTube":82,"Instagram":78,"X":66},
        "comparables": [{"title":"From 0 to 1 with AI","why_similar":"confession hook","delta":"+faster cuts"}],
        "next_actions": ["Export tighter intro","Schedule 8 PM CST","Share score card on profile"],
        "pro_features_used": [],
        "compliance_notes_applied": []
    })
Then:

Commit & push to GitHub.

In Render → your Web Service → Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Open /docs again — you’ll see the Authorize lock icon (top-right).

How to generate a token
Use the same secret you set on Render (JWT_SECRET):

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # must match Render env
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
In Swagger, click Authorize, paste Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE, then “Authorize” → “Close”. Now you can “Try it out” on /api/analyze.

Want me to switch the endpoint from mock to real OpenAI next?

Thought for 5s
It’s working! 🎉
Those logs show your API is live at https://govirall.onrender.com. The 404 Not Found on / is normal—we didn’t make a homepage.

Quick win: test it now (no Swagger auth button needed)
PowerShell (on your computer):

# 1) create a token using the SAME JWT_SECRET you set on Render
python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # <- must match Render env
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Copy the printed token into:

$TOKEN = "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
You should get the JSON with score, hooks, etc.

Want the Authorize button in /docs?
If you don’t see it, swap your main.py for this slight update (adds Bearer auth in Swagger):

# main.py — ViralNOW API (adds Swagger Authorize)
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI(title="ViralNOW API (Root Layout)")

security = HTTPBearer(auto_error=False)

def require_bearer(creds: Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials] = Depends(security)):
    if not creds or creds.scheme.lower() != "bearer" or not creds.credentials:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Missing or bad token")
    # TODO: verify JWT with your JWT_SECRET if you want strict auth
    return {"user_id": "demo-user", "tier": "free"}

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"ok": True}

@app.post("/api/analyze")
async def analyze(payload: dict, _user = Depends(require_bearer)):
    # mock response for now
    return JSONResponse({
        "ok": True,
        "viral_score": 82,
        "confidence": "91%",
        "summary": "Tight hook and clean pacing; clear payoff.",

    })
Then:

Commit & push.

In Render → Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy.

Go to /docs → the lock icon (Authorize) will appear.

Generate a token as above, click Authorize, paste Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE, then test the endpoint in the browser.

Optional: add a tiny homepage (to remove the 404 on /)
Append this to main.py:

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"status": "ok", "docs": "/docs", "health": "/health"}
Redeploy.

Ready for real AI (instead of mock)?
In Render → Settings → Environment, add:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
Replace the mock JSON inside /api/analyze with a real OpenAI call (I can paste a drop-in when you say “switch to real AI”).

Want me to generate a simple, luxury-looking front-end page that hits this API? Say “frontend MVP” and I’ll give you a ready-to-copy Next.js page.

WQHERE IOS THE TOCKEN I NEED TO PASTE
ChatGPT said:
Here’s exactly where to get the token and where to paste it.

Step 1 — Make (or check) your secret on Render
Render → your Web Service → Settings → Environment
If it’s not there, add:

JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string
Save (auto-redeploy). Keep that value handy.

Step 2 — Generate a token on your computer
Open PowerShell and run (replace the secret with the one on Render):

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # must match Render's JWT_SECRET
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
It will print a long string starting with eyJ… — that’s your token.

Step 3 — Paste the token
A) In Swagger (/docs) with the Authorize button
Open: https://govirall.onrender.com/docs

Click Authorize (lock icon, top-right)

Paste this exactly (include the word Bearer):

Bearer PASTE_THE_TOKEN_HERE
Click Authorize → Close, then “Try it out” on POST /api/analyze.

B) In PowerShell (no Swagger needed)
$TOKEN = "PASTE_THE_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Don’t see the Authorize button?
Your main.py might not include the Swagger security scheme. I can give you a tiny patch to add it (so the button appears). Want me to send it?

You said:
IS IT THE DEPOKLOY HOOK
ChatGPT said:

Thought for a few seconds
Short answer: No—the Deploy Hook is not the token.

Deploy Hook (Render): a special URL you can POST to in order to trigger a new deploy of your service. It has nothing to do with calling your API.

Token (JWT): a string you generate using your JWT_SECRET. You paste this into Swagger → Authorize (as Bearer <token>) or send it in the Authorization header when calling your API.

What you should do right now
Confirm your secret on Render

Render → your Web Service → Settings → Environment

Make sure you have: JWT_SECRET=change_me_to_a_long_random_string

Generate a token on your computer (PowerShell)

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
SECRET = "change_me_to_a_long_random_string"  # must match Render's JWT_SECRET
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, SECRET, algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Copy the printed eyJ... string. That’s the token.

Use the token

Swagger (/docs): click Authorize (lock icon, top-right) → paste:

Bearer PASTE_TOKEN_HERE
then try POST /api/analyze.

PowerShell:

$TOKEN = "PASTE_TOKEN_HERE"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
If you don’t see the Authorize button in /docs
We can add it (Swagger security scheme) so the button appears. Say “add authorize button” and I’ll give you the tiny main.py patch.

Want to skip auth for a minute?
Replace your /api/analyze route’s dependency check with a no-op (for testing), and redeploy. I can send that snippet too if you want.

You said:
I PASTED IT
ChatGPT said:
Great. Two quick ways to confirm it’s working—pick one.

A) In the browser (/docs)
Go to https://govirall.onrender.com/docs

Click Authorize (lock icon) → make sure you pasted with the word Bearer:

Bearer eyJ...
(No quotes. One line.)

Expand POST /api/analyze → Try it out → paste this body:

{
  "media": { "caption": "Test caption" },
  "platform_focus": "tiktok"
}
Click Execute.
✅ Success = JSON back with viral_score, hook_variations, etc.
❌ If you see 401: see “Fixes” below.

B) From PowerShell
$TOKEN = "eyJ...YOUR_TOKEN..."
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = @'
{ "media": { "caption": "Test caption" }, "platform_focus": "tiktok" }
'@
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
Common fixes if it errors
401 Unauthorized

Ensure you included the prefix exactly: Bearer (with a space) before the token.

The token must be created with the same JWT_SECRET that’s set on Render.

Token shouldn’t have quotes or extra spaces.

No Authorize button visible

Your main.py might not include the Swagger security scheme. I can give you the tiny patch to add it—just say “add authorize button”.

500 Internal Server Error

Check Render Logs (Web Service → Logs). Copy the first 5 error lines and I’ll translate the fix.

If you hit a snag, tell me exactly what status code you got (e.g., 200, 401, 500) and any short error message, and I’ll give you the precise next step.

You said:
IT WORKED
ChatGPT said:
LET’S GO! 🚀
You’ve got a live API and auth working. Here’s your tight next-steps playbook—pick what you want to do next.

1) Switch from mock → real AI (when ready)
Add/confirm env on Render → Settings → Environment

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # your real key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini       # safe default
Drop-in real AI code (replace your /api/analyze handler body):

# inside main.py, replace the mock return with this:
import os, json
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
MODEL = os.getenv("OPENAI_MODEL", "gpt-4o-mini")

prompt = {
  "instruction":"Return viral analysis as strict JSON per contract.",
  "media": payload.get("media", {}),
  "platform_focus": payload.get("platform_focus","tiktok"),
  "controls":{
    "readability_grade":"6-8",
    "summary_max_words":28,
    "rationale_max_words":40,
    "ab_tagging_for_hooks":True
  }
}
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=MODEL,
  temperature=0.6,
  messages=[
    {"role":"system","content":"You are ViralNOW… (paste your full system prompt here)"},
    {"role":"user","content":json.dumps(prompt)}
  ],
)
content = resp.choices[0].message.content
# trust but verify: parse JSON or fallback
try:
    data = json.loads(content)
except:
    # light fix if model wrapped text; extract JSON braces
    start, end = content.find("{"), content.rfind("}")
    data = json.loads(content[start:end+1])
return JSONResponse(data)
Redeploy (Manual Deploy → Clear build cache & deploy).

2) Add credits (optional freemium)
If you want “3 free per day”:

Create Key Value on Render (Redis-compatible). Copy its connection string.

Add env:

DISABLE_CREDITS=false
FREEMIUM_DAILY_CREDITS=3
ANALYZE_COST=1
REDIS_URL=redis://...   # from Key Value
Redeploy. 4th call should 402 “not enough credits”.

3) Quick homepage + nicer docs
Add to main.py:

@app.get("/")
def home():
    return {"status":"ok","docs":"/docs","health":"/health"}
Redeploy (gets rid of 404 on /).

4) One-liner test scripts you can reuse
PowerShell (save as call_analyze.ps1):

param([string]$caption = "Test caption")
$TOKEN = "PASTE_YOUR_JWT"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $TOKEN" }
$body = "{ ""media"":{ ""caption"":""$caption"" }, ""platform_focus"":""tiktok"" }"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://govirall.onrender.com/api/analyze" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body $body -ContentType "application/json" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 6
5) Simple security & reliability tweaks
CORS (if you’ll hit from a web app):

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=["*"], allow_methods=["*"], allow_headers=["*"])
Rate limit later (to prevent abuse): use a gateway or a simple Redis counter.

Uptime pings: add a free Render cron/health check or external monitor (e.g., BetterStack) to hit /health.

6) Frontend MVP (optional—looks “simple but expensive”)
Say “frontend MVP” and I’ll drop a Next.js page that:

accepts caption or URL,

calls your endpoint with the Bearer token,

renders Viral Score, tagged hooks, and next actions with sleek styling.

7) Your current cheat sheet
Service URL: https://govirall.onrender.com

Health: /health

Docs: /docs

Start command (Render): uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

Token generation (PowerShell):

python - <<'PY'
from jose import jwt
print(jwt.encode({"sub":"demo-user","tier":"free"}, "YOUR_JWT_SECRET", algorithm="HS256"))
PY
Want me to paste the full, cleaned main.py with Swagger Authorize + CORS + mock/real toggle?
