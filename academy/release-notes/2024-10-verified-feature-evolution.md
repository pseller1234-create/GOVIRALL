## 1. Verified Feature Evolution Summary
- **Codebase Foundation:** Established `AGENTS.md` to codify contributor workflow, security posture, and automation requirements for ViralNow Codex projects.
- **Lifecycle Alignment:** Introduced `/academy/release-notes` to centralize Virality Evolution PR narratives, guaranteeing that every change ships with reproducible documentation and embedded learning assets.

## 2. Feature Diffs & Artifacts
| Area | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Developer Workflow | Added `AGENTS.md` with commands for setup, testing, linting, type checking, and security scanning. | `AGENTS.md` |
| Documentation | Created release note directory anchoring the Verified Feature Evolution cadence. | `academy/release-notes/` |

## 3. Learning Model Updates
While no model weights changed in this iteration, the new workflow mandates that future PRs document prompt schemas, evaluation datasets, and regression metrics alongside code diffs to maintain an auditable trail for model evolution.

## 4. UX Tweaks Driven by Engagement Metrics
Pending integration of analytics dashboards. This release prepares the documentation surface so UX research summaries, funnel metrics, and A/B learnings can be logged with each Virality Evolution PR.

## 5. Embedded Tutorial — Shipping a Virality Evolution PR
